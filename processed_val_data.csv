"the present invention is described in the following with a specific embodiment, so that one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand other advantages and effects of the present invention from the disclosure of the invention. the present invention may also be implemented and applied according to other embodiments, and the details may be modified based on different views and applications without departing from the spirit of the invention. fig1 to 5 are diagrams drawn according to the preferred embodiments of the light - guiding device of the present invention. these drawings are simplified diagrams schematically illustrating the basic structure of the present invention, therefore, only display the compositions related to the present invention. further, the displayed compositions are not drawn in accordance with the amount, shape, and dimensional ratio during implementing. the actual amount, shape, and dimensional ratio during implementing may be a kind of selective design, and the types of composition layout may be more complicated. fig1 is an explosive view illustrating a panel 1 and a light - guiding device of the preferred embodiment according to the present invention. the panel 1 has at least a through hole 11. the light - guiding device comprises a sleeve part 2 and a light guide 3. in general, the panel 1 has a plurality of through holes 11 equally spaced on a surface of the panel 1 for acting as heat exchanging paths and observation holes from which users are able to monitor statuses of an indicator light. in the preferred embodiment embodiment, the through holes 11 corresponding to the positions of the indicator lights are all in the shape of an ellipse, that may function as marking the installation position of the light - guiding device and bring the effect of directivity orientation after installation. however, one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand that the shape of the through hole 11 does not affect the applied scope of the present invention. in other embodiments, the through hole with, such as circular shape, may be applied to a panel, and it is not limited by this embodiment. fig2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the sleeve part 2 of the light - guiding device according to the present invention. the sleeve part 2 comprises a first combining portion 21 and a positioning portion 23 corresponding to the panel 1 for positioning the sleeve part 2 on the panel 1. in the preferred embodiment, the sleeve part 2 further comprises a holding portion 25. the holding portion 25 comprises two holding parts symmetrically installed a predetermined distance apart from each other for generating corresponding recovery elasticity after being expanded and distorted. the first combining portion 21 is formed on an inner side of the holding portion 25 and has for example a groove structure. more particularly, the first combining portion 21 ( such as a groove ) is installed in a middle region of the holding portion 25 ( such as two holding parts ) and perpendicular to the holding portion 25. the first positioning portion 23 is used to fix to the panel 1. according to the preferred embodiment, the positioning portion 23 comprises a sleeve head 231 formed at an end of the sleeve part 2, and an inverted hook 233 formed on an outer side of the holding portion 25. the sleeve head 231 has an annular structure and is larger than the through hole 11 of the panel 1 in width. moreover, the inverted hook 233 keeps away from the sleeve head 231 a distance equal to a depth of the through hole 11 of the panel 1. fig3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the light guide 3 of the light - guiding device according to the present invention. the light guide 3 comprises a second combining portion 31, which is able to engaged with the first combining portion 21. according to the preferred embodiment, the light guide 3 is a light - guiding pillar. the second combining portion 31 is for example a bump formed on an outer side of the light guide 3. the light guide 3 further comprises an expanding portion 33 having a conical structure and is formed at an end of the light guide 3. the expanding portion 33 expands a light reception area on the end of the light guide 3, and thus enhances light reception and light conduction efficiencies. furthermore, in order to obtain a better light - guiding effect, the light guide 3 is made of acrylic, and has a photo - resistive layer attached on the outer surface of the light guide 3 to prevent conductive light inside the light - guiding 3 from leaking to a region outside of the light guide 3, such that affects the effect of light conduction or interferes other light guides 3. fig4 is a side view illustrating an installation of the sleeve part 2 on the light guide 3 according to the present invention. the light guide 3 is held in the holding portion 25 of the sleeve part 2 and fixed to the sleeve part 2 by the first combining portion 21 and the second combining portion 31. an end of the light guide 3 is inserted in the sleeve head 231 of the sleeve part 2. since the first combining portion 21 is formed on the inner side ( i. e. holding side ) of the holding portion 25, when the light guide 3 holds open the holding portion 25 and is installed on a corresponding position, the first combining portion 21 holds the second combining portion 31 automatically due the recovery elasticity of the holding portion 25, and the light guide 3 is positioned on the sleeve part 2 accordingly. thus, the installation of the light guide 3 on the sleeve part 2 becomes very convenient. on the other hand, the light guide 3 is easily escaped from sleeve part 2 by expanding the holding portion 25 outward. moreover, since the holding portion 25 comprises two symmetrically holding parts, which generate the recovery elasticity after being expanded or being compressed, when the light guide 3 is installed in and held by the holding portion 25, a compression space of the holding portion 25 is limited, so as to realize the function of locating the positioning portion 23 on the panel. fig5 a is a schematic diagram illustrating the light - guiding device and the panel 1 after the light - guiding device has been fixed to the panel 1. fig5 b is a side view the light - guiding device and the panel 1 after the light - guiding device has been fixed to the panel 1. firstly, the sleeve part 2 is installed in the corresponding through hole 11 from a region outside of the panel 1, and is fixed to the panel 1 by the positioning portion 23. since the inverted hook 233 has an oblique guiding surface design, the holding portion 25 will be guided to shrink inward when the sleeve part 2 is passing through the through hole 11, and the inverted hook 233 is hooked to an inside surface of the panel 1 by the recovery elasticity of the holding portion 25 when the sleeve head 231 presses against the outside surface of the panel 1, so as to realize the function of locating the positioning portion 23 on the panel 1. after the sleeve part 2 is positioned on the panel 1 as described above, then the light guide 3 is assembled to the sleeve part 2, such that the light - guiding device of the present invention is fixed to the panel 1. since the compressed space of the holding space 25 is limited by holding the light guide 3 in the holding portion 25 after the installation of the light guide 3 and the sleeve part 2, the holding portion 25 cannot be compressed at that time, and then the inverted hook 233 of the positioning portion 23 is relative in a fixed status, so as to ensure the locating effect of the positioning portion 23 and the panel 1. although the implementation technique of the first and second combining portions is described by for example, a groove - bump fasten design in the above embodiment, however, one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand the fastening design of the groove and bump is only an example of combining structures, any design such as, buckle groove and protruding edge, internal thread and external thread, and tightly co - operated taper, may realize the same combining effect. therefore, the first and second combining portions of the present invention are not limited by the groove and bump of the above embodiment. furthermore, although the implementation technique of the positioning portion is described by for example, a sleeve head and an inverted hook design in the above embodiment, however, one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand the clamping design of the sleeve head and an inverted hook is only an example of combining structures, any design that utilizes the sleeve part & # 39 ; s shape design or matches the installation of the light guide can implement the same clamping locating effect, such as matching the sleeve head and the shoulder part preformed on the light guide, or simply utilizing the mutual installation of the sleeve part and light guide to force the sleeve head to expansively locate, and so on. therefore, the positioning portion of the present invention is not only limited by the design including the sleeve head and inverted hook of the above embodiment. it can be understood by synthesizing the above embodiments, the light - guiding device of the present invention utilizes a design of the second combining portion of the light guide to match with a design of the first combining portion and positioning portion, so as to realize the effect of fixedly installing on the panel, to provide the effect of assembling and disassembling easily, and to provide the effect of reusable light guide and sleeve part. at the same time, since the structure design is simple and the whole panel does not need to be replaced when the light guide damages, it has the effect to reduce the cost, so as to overcome the defects of the conventional technique, such as hard to assemble and disassemble, complicated structure, low reuse ability, high cost, and so on. although the foregoing embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, it is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but rather to enable others skilled in the art to best understand and utilize the invention with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims and their equivalents.","a light - guiding device applicable to a panel having at least a through hole includes a sleeve part and a light guide . the sleeve part is able to be mounted on the through hole , and includes a first combining portion and a positioning portion corresponding to the panel for positioning the sleeve portion on the panel . the light guide includes a second combining portion for engaging with the first combining portion , so as to fix the light guide on the panel in cooperation with the sleeve part , allowing an assembling / disassembling process of the light - guiding device to be easily performed ."
"since the xerographic reproducing process is well known, a detailed description thereof is omitted. for those who would consider a description of a xerographic process necessary for a complete understanding of the present invention, reference may be had to u. s. pat. nos. 3, 718, 116, 3, 745, 972 and 3, 861, 860 which patents are incorporated herein by reference. as shown in fig1 the present invention comprises a fuser roll assembly 15 including a heated roll structure 30 including a hollow cylinder or core 31 having a suitable heating element 32 disposed in the hollow portion thereof and which is coextensive with the longitudinal axis of said cylinder or core. the core 31 has provided on the outer surface thereof a layer of silicone rubber 34 or other suitable material which has adhesive characteristics, therefore, tendency to release toner type contaminants therefrom. the heating element 32 may comprise a suitable type heater for elevating the surface of the silicone rubber layer to operational temperatures, therefore, temperatures on the order of 250 to 450 f. for example, the heating element may comprise a quartz lamp. the cylinder or core 31 is fabricated from any thermally conductive material, for example, steel, aluminum, or alloys thereof. the resulting structure has an outside diameter on the order of 1. 5 to 3. 0 inches and a length on the order of 10 to 15 inches. power requirements for the foregoing are 500 - 2500 watts, peak power with an average power 300 - 2000 watts and 75 - 250 watts for standby. the surface temperature of the fuser roll structure is controlled by contacting the surface thereof with a thermistor probe 36 in a manner described in u. s. pat. no. 3, 327, 096, issued in 1967 to bernous and incorporated herein by reference. to this end, the end of the roll contacted by the thermistor probe 36 may be specifically designed to accommodate such control of the operating temperature. in other words, means may be provided to reduce friction between the probe 36 and the surface of the fuser roll structure. one method of accomplishing the foregoing would be to manufacture the fuser roll structure 30 such that the end thereof contacted by the probe 36 is devoid of silicone rubber material whereby the probe contacts the core and the set point of the thermistor is adjusted accordingly. the fuser assembly 15 further comprises a backup roll structure 38 which cooperates with the fuser roll structure to form a nip 40 through which copy paper or substrate material 42 passes such that toner images 44 thereon contact the surface of the fuser roll structure 30. the backup roll structure may comprise any suitable construction for example, a steel cylinder, but preferably comprises a rigid steel core 46 having a viton elastomer surface or layer 48 which as can be observed has a relatively large thickness in order to provide a soft member which can be indented by the fuser roll structure 30 in order to form the nip 40. after the copy sheet or substrate material 42 passes through the nip 40 it tends to stick or adhere to the surface of the fuser roll structure 30. accordingly, stripper finger structure 50 is provided for stripping the copy sheet or substrate material from the surface of the fuser roll structure 30 so that the copy sheets can continue on their intended path of movement toward the exit of the copier apparatus. as noted hereinbefore, as the copy sheets 42 pass through the nip 40 in contact with the surface of the fuser roll structure 30 and the backup roll structure 38 contaminants are offset onto the surface of the fuser roll structure 30. because the surface of the fuser roll structure 30 comprises the aforementioned silicone rubber which constitutes an adhesive material, the contaminants can be readily removed from the fuser roll structure 30. also noted above was the fact that tacky surfaced cleaning rolls such as cleaning roll structure 54 shown in its operative position ( i. e. engaged with the fuser roll structure 30 ) for removing contaminants such as toner and paper fiber from fuser roll structures are well known. in its inoperative position the roll structure 54 is moved out of engagement from the fuser roll structure. one form of such a cleaning roll structure comprises a sleeve carried by a core member which is, in turn, rotatingly supported by means of a shaft, the ends of which are supported by end plates ( not shown ) of a support mechanism 62. a cleaning structure of this type is disclosed in u. s. pat. no. 3, 861, 860 issued in the name of thettu and incorporated herein by reference. as described in the foregoing patent, the sleeve is provided with a polymer material which is tacky at the operating temperature of the fuser roll structure. the polymer material preferably comprises a material selected from the group of aliphatic, aromatic or mixtures of aliphatic, aromatic polyesters which have a melting or softening point ranging from about 120 to about 275 c. consequently, the polymer provides an effective mechanism for removing the contaminants 52 from the surface of the fuser roll structure 30. the cleaning roll structure 54 comprises a sleeve 56 which is provided with a polymer material which is tacky at the operating temperature of the fuser roll structure. the polymer material forms a layer 58 on the outer surface of the roll structure 54. a heater 80 is provided internally of said cleaning roll structure for softening the polymer material. in operation, the toner and other contaminants removed from the fuser roll structure become embedded in the outer layer 58 and during certain modes of operation ( i. e. short copy runs ) the contaminants are worked into the layer of polymer material and are mixed adequately therewith. however, during certain other modes of operation ( i. e. longer copy runs ) a much greater quantity of contaminants must be handled, and therefore, there isn & # 39 ; t sufficient time to become mixed into the polymer layer of the cleaning roll structure 54. accordingly, a combination mixing and adhesive supply roll structure 60 is provided for obviating this condition. the mixing adhesive supply roll 60 comprise a metal core 62 covered with a tacky polymeric layer 64. by the provision of the roll structure 60 and its tacky polymer layer 64, a cross mixing of contaminants and polymer material between the cleaning roll and the roll structure 60 results which tends to obviate the condition where the toner contaminant transfer rate from fuser roll structure to the cleaning roll structure is greater than the rate at which the contaminants can become embedded in the polymer layer on the cleaning roll structure. a roll structure 66 comprising a core 68 and an elastomeric surface or outer coating 70 is provided for smoothing irregularities on the roll structure 60 to thereby prevent damage occurring to the cleaning roll structure by sharp edges formed on the roll structure 60. the support structure 62 is pivotably supported as indicated at 72 and can therefore be pivoted clockwise to remove the cleaning roll structure from engagement with the fuser roll structure and then in a counterclockwise direction to effect engagement therebetween. a spring 74 provides a simple bias means for maintaining proper engagement of the cleaning roll structure and the fuser roll structure. the rolls 54, 60 and 66 are sequentially engaged during operation as illustrated in the drawings. the sequential engagement is achieved by cam mechanism which is essential for smooth operation of the system. in the engagement sequence the cleaning roll 54 contacts heated fuser roll 30 initially which is followed by supply and mixing roll 60 contacting cleaning roll 54 and finally smoothing roll 66 contacts supply and mixing roll. individual cam and follower ( not shown ) pairs which may be solenoid actuated are provided for effecting engagement of the rolls 54 and 60 in the sequence described. however, it is desirable that all of the rolls be disengaged from each other during inoperative periods. accordingly, disengagement means ( not shown ) in the form of conventional cams and cam followers may be employed for such purposes in accordance with skills known in the art. a supply of thermal energy, for example, a cal rod heater 65 having a capacity on the order of 25 - 30 watts is provided internally of the structure 60. the roll structure 66 is also provided internally thereof with a source of thermal energy 67. the sources of energy 65 and 67 assist in maintaining the tacky polymer on the roll structures 54 and 60 in a softened condition. optionally, the roll structures 54 and 60 are driven separately with overriding clutches to reduce the drive torque on the fuser roll member during the mixing mode. a modified form of the invention as illustrated in fig2 is identical to the structure disclosed in fig1 with the exception that the roll structure 66 is held in contact with the heated fuser roll structure during operation which thereby renders unnecessry the employment of an internal heat source for such roll structure. in the modified form of the invention embodiment the engagement sequence is slightly modified by allowing the smoothing roll and cleaning roll contacting the fuser roll simultaneously or first and second respectively. the mixing and supply roll next makes contact with smoothing roll prior to contacting the cleaning roll. while the invention has been disclosed in conjunction with the preferred embodiments of the invention, modifications thereto within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art and such modifications are intended to be covered by the claims appended hereto.","a contact fuser assembly for use in electrostatic reproducing apparatus , said assembly including a heated fuser roll

"fig2 illustrates a communication system 10 including devices configured with tone estimation capabilities in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. the exemplary embodiments described herein can be applied to any telecommunications system including an electronic device with a speech synthesis application and / or a speech recognition application, and a server, between which data can be transmitted. communication system 10 includes a terminal equipment ( te ) device 12, an access point ( ap ) 14, a server 16, and a network 18. the te device 12 can include memory ( mem ), a central processing unit ( cpu ), a user interface ( ui ), and an input - output interface ( i / o ). the memory can include non - volatile memory for storing applications that control the cpu and random access memory for data processing. a speech synthesis ( ss ) module, such as a text - to - speech ( tts ) module, can be implemented by executing in the cpu programmed instructions stored in the memory. a speech recognition ( sr ) module can be implemented by executing in the cpu programmed instructions stored in the memory. the i / o interface can include a network interface card of a wireless local area network, such as one of the cards based on the ieee 802. 11 standards. the te device 12 can be connected to the network 18 ( e. g., a local area network ( lan ), the internet, a phone network ) via the access point 14 and further to the server 16. the te device 12 can also communicate directly with the server 16, for instance using a cable, infrared, or a data transmission at radio frequencies. the server 16 can provide various processing functions for the te device 12. the server 16 can provide back - end processing services for the te device 12. the te device 12 can be any portable electronic device, in which speech recognition or speech synthesis is performed, for example a personal digital assistant ( pda ) device, remote controller or a combination of an earpiece and a microphone. the te device 12 can be a supplementary device used by a computer or a mobile station, in which case the data transmission to the server 16 can be arranged via a computer or a mobile station. in an exemplary embodiment, the te device 12 is a mobile station communicating with a public land mobile network, to which also the server s is functionally connected. the te device 12 connected to the network 18 includes mobile station functionality for communicating with the network 18 wirelessly. the network 18 can be any known wireless network, for instance a network supporting the gsm service, a network supporting the gprs ( general packet radio service ), or a third generation mobile network, such the umts ( universal mobile telecommunications system ) network according to the 3gpp ( 3 rd generation partnership project ) standard. the functionality of the server 16 can also be implemented in the mobile network. the te device 16 can be a mobile phone used for speaking only, or it can also contain pda ( personal digital assistant ) functionality. the te device 12 can utilize tone pattern information, which is used to decide tone of no - tone pinyin sequence, or other sequences that do not have tonal information but where tonal information is important. the te device 12 can acquire such information via the network 18, or can be acquired offline before it is used. tone patterns can be captured from a database, and then saved in a certain model as pre - knowledge. the model could be a classification and regression tree ( cart ) tree or neural network and other structure. in an alternative embodiment, the server 16 estimates tonal information and communicates the tonal information attached to the text to the te device 12. fig3 illustrates a flow diagram 20 of exemplary operations performed in a process of classifying tone information. additional, fewer, or different operations may be performed, depending on the embodiment. in an exemplary embodiment, a classification and regression tree ( cart ) is used. cart can be used for predicting continuous dependent variables ( regression ) and categorical predictor variables ( classification ). in an operation 22, a database and design feature set is collected. preferably, the database contains main features of tone pattern in application domain. for example, to collect database for chinese name feedback, the name list should be large enough, all chinese surname and frequently used given names should be included. different length names should be also taken into consideration. based on a feature set, all feature are calculated for each entry in database. fig4 illustrates an exemplary feature set 30, which is depicted as ( ( tone 0 1 2 3 4 ) ( n : : final ) ( t : : initial ) ( t : final ) ( n : : initial ) ). the values p, t and n refer to previous syllable, current syllable and next syllable, respectively. tone 0 1 2 3 4 refers to various different tones. the feature set 30 can be stored in a memory on a communication terminal. referring again to fig3, in an operation 24, the model is trained using a training algorithm. the training algorithm is used to extract essential tone pattern information into a training database. the training process is complete when a specified criterion is satisfied, such as maximum entropy. a decision tree such as the cart structure 40 can be used to generate suitable tones for a sequence of input syllables. the decision tree is trained on an tagged database. a decision tree is composed of nodes that are linked together as illustrated in fig5. an attribute is attached to each node. the attribute specifies what kind of context information is considered in the node. the context information may include the syllables on the left and right hand side of the current syllable. some smaller units, such as initial / final can be used. in addition, the previous initial / final syllables and their classes may be used. each node of the tree is followed by child nodes, unless the node is a leaf. movement from a node to a child node is based on the values of the attribute specified in the node. when the decision tree is used for retrieving the tone that corresponds to the syllable in a certain context, the search starts at the root node. the tree is climbed until a leaf is found. the tone that corresponds to the syllable in the given context is stored in the leaf. when a decision tree is trained from a tagged database, all the training cases are considered. a training case is composed of the syllable and tone context and the corresponding tone in the tagged database. during training, the decision tree is grown and the nodes of the decision tree are split into child nodes according to an information theoretic optimization criterion. the splitting continues until the optimization criterion cannot be further improved. in training, the root node of the tree is split first. in order to split the node into child nodes, an attribute has to be chosen. all the different attributes are tested and the one that maximizes the optimization criterion is chosen. information gain is used as the optimization criterion. in order to compute the information gain of a split, the tone distribution before splitting the root node has to be known. based on the tone distribution in the root node, the entropy e is computed according to : e = - i = l n f i log 2 f i where f i is the relative frequency of occurrence for the i th tone, and n is the number of tones. based on the syllable and tone contexts, the training cases in the root node are split into subsets according to the possible attributes. for an attribute, the entropy after the split, e s, is computed as the average entropy of the entropies of the subsets. if e j s denotes the entropy of the subset j after the split, the average entropy after the split is : e s = - j = l k s j s e j s where | s | is the total number of training cases in the root node, | s j | is the number of training cases in the j th subset, and k is the number of subsets. the information gain for an attribute is given by : the information gain is computed for each attribute, and the attribute that has the highest information gain is selected. the splitting of the nodes in the tree is repeated for the child nodes. the training cases belonging to each child node are further split into subsets according to the different attributes. for each child node, the attribute that has the highest information gain is selected. the splitting of the nodes in the tree continues while the information gain is greater than zero and the entropies of the nodes can be improved by splitting. in addition to the information gain, the splitting is controlled by a second condition. a node can be split only if there are at least two child nodes that will have at least a preset minimum number of training cases after the split. if the information gain is zero or the second condition is not met, the node is not split. fig5 illustrates a cart structure 40 depicting an example of training results. the cart structure 40 shows relationships between nodes in a tone estimation model. if the current syllable begins with m and ends with ao, tone 2 is identified. if the current syllable begins with m : and does not end with ao, tone 3 is identified. referring again to fig3, in an operation 26, the training results are converted to a compressed format to save memory space and accelerate the usage procedure. the tone pattern information is stored in training results. in an operation 28, the tone pattern is generated. when a syllable sequence is coming, all syllables can be used to switch between tree branches, and go through tree from top until a leaf is reached. referring now to fig5, for example, if the cart structure 40 is used and a coming pinyin string is mao ze dong, for the first syllable mao, its initial is m, according to the top node, switch to right branch, then according to the second level node, its final is ao, switch to right branch again and reach the leaf node, so tone for mao will be set as 2. fig6 illustrates a flow diagram 50 of exemplary operations performed in a tone estimation process. additional, fewer, or different operations may be performed, depending on the embodiment. in an operation 52, a processing unit in a terminal equipment ( te ) device obtains a syllable sequence. the syllable sequence can be one or more words. the processing unit can obtain the syllable sequence from memory. in general, the processing unit operates based on programmed instructions also contained in memory. in an operation 54, the processing unit parses the individual syllables. tone information is obtained or estimated based on the parsed text in an operation 56. for example, tone pattern information contained in a feature set can provide information from which the processing unit identifies corresponding tones. the feature set can be embodied in a cart structure such as cart structure 40 described with reference to fig4. while several embodiments of the invention have been described, it is to be understood that modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains. for example, although chinese is used as an example language requiring tonal information, the system is not limited to operation with a particular language. accordingly, the claims appended to this specification are intended to define the invention precisely.","the techniques described include generating tonal information from a textual entry and , further , applying this tonal information to pinyin sequences using decision trees . for example , a method of predicting tone pattern information for textual information used in telecommunication systems includes parsing a textual entry into segments and identifying tonal information for the textual entry using the parsed segments . the tonal information can be generated with a decision tree . the method can also be implemented in a distributed system where the conversion is done at a back - end server and the information is sent to a communication device after a request ."
"although the present invention is open to various modifications and alternative constructions, a preferred exemplary embodiment that is shown in the drawings is described herein in detail. it is to be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed. one skilled in the art can recognize that there are numerous modifications, equivalences and alternative constructions that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the claims. referring now to fig1 there is illustrated a microprocessor 100 such as a pentium processor. ( one skilled in the art, however, can recognize that the present invention is not limited to the specific microprocessor configured as shown in fig1. ) the microprocessor 100 includes a bus interface unit 105 connected to a code - cache 110 and a data - cache 115. moreover, the microprocessor 100 includes a branch predictor unit 120 and an instruction prefetch buffer and decode unit 125 for passing instructions to the arithmetic decode logic units ( alus ) 130 contained inside the execution unit 135. if necessary, data with decimal fractions, such as 33. 3, that need processing are passed to the floating point unit 140. the microprocessor 100 also includes a mmx unit 145, which is a standard part of later pentium - type microprocessors and many other microprocessors. conventionally, the mmx unit 145 is used for speeding up the processing of multi - media data for graphics, video and sound because graphics intensive applications have certain characteristics that lend themselves to specific types of processing. for example, many algorithms use multiple repetitive loops and operate on small data quantities. the mmx unit 145 has been designed to meet these processing requirements and to deliver higher multimedia performance. thus, when the instructions passed to the microprocessor 100 request certain types of operations that involve graphics audio or video, those requests are routed to the mmx unit 145. mmx technology uses a technique called single instruction, multiple data ( simd ) that speeds up software performance by using a single instruction to process multiple data elements in parallel ( in contrast to the less efficient scheme in which a single instruction operates on a single piece of data ). for example, graphics information represented in 8 - bit blocks that once required eight repetitions of a single instruction is now executed with a single mmx technology instruction. the result, a performance increase for this operation of up to 8x. to achieve this performance increase, mmx technology incorporates 57 new instructions ( specifically designed to manipulate and process video, audio and graphical data more efficiently ) and four new data types. these features deliver more calculations for each processor clock cycle and result in faster execution times and higher performance. in fact, the mmx unit technology enhances many types of software other than multimedia. although the mmx unit 145 is advantageous for performing small repetitious operations, an mmx unit such as mmx unit 145 generally is not used during post. that is, the mmx unit 145 is not used during the early stages of boot - up. because the mmx unit & # 39 ; s 145 instruction set includes instructions for moving data between the individual mmx registers 150 and the general purpose registers 155, the mmx registers 150 can be used to streamline bios coding and overcome the difficulties with traditional bios coding. moreover, one skilled in the art can recognize that other registers besides the mmx registers 150 can be used in a fashion similar to that described herein. in one embodiment of the present invention, the mmx registers 150 contained inside the mmx unit 145 are used as simulated general purpose registers 155. thus, instead of having just the eight general purpose registers 155 in the execution unit 135, the bios coder also could use the mmx registers 150 ( for a total of 16 registers ) to store data during booting procedures. however, the simulation of general purpose registers 155 by the mmx registers 150 still presents problems for the bios coder in that a jump interface rather than calls and returns must be used. that is, the bios coder must still store a return address in one of either the general purpose register 155 or the mmx registers 150, must remember at which register that return address was stored, and must not overwrite that register with other data. in another embodiment of the present invention, however, the mmx registers 150 are used to create a virtual stack that allows bios coders to use simulated call and return ( push / pop ) routines that are associated with conventional modular coding. for example, special macros can simulate some, all, or any combination of a push, a pop, a call and return using a virtual stack created from the mmx registers 150. these macros are made possible by the fact that the microprocessor includes an instruction set that allows movement of data between the individual mmx registers 150 and the general purpose registers 155 in the execution unit 135. for example, a push ( a virtual push ) would transfer data from one of the general purpose registers 155 onto the top of the virtual stack. a pop ( a virtual pop ), on the other hand, would transfer data from the top of the virtual stack to one of the general purpose registers 155. similarly, a call results in a push of the address of the currently executed instruction and a jump to the called routine. moreover, a return results in a pop of a return address and a corresponding jump. accordingly, bios programmers can use the virtual stack to code in a conventional modular fashion, thereby freeing up the general purpose registers 155 for more advanced coding practices. moreover, by creating a virtual stack using the mmx registers 150, bios coders can code in a more efficient manner and debug in a more satisfactory fashion. referring now to fig2 there are illustrated the mmx registers 150 of the mmx unit 145. these mmx registers 150 can be manipulated in a variety of ways to create a virtual stack. for example, fig2 shows a virtual stack maintained with a traditional stack pointer ( sp ). the virtual stack includes the eight mmx registers 150 in the mmx unit 145. the mmx registers are numbered 0 through 6 and sp. still referring to fig2 registers 0 through 3 include data ( such as addresses ) and register sp includes a pointer to the top of the virtual stack, which happens to be register 3. in this type of stack management system, a pop on the virtual stack would result in the data d being extracted from register 3 and the stack pointer being adjusted to reflect that the top of the virtual stack is now register 2. thus, any manipulation of this type of virtual stack would require a read of register sp before any data could be popped or pushed to / from the virtual stack. moreover, this type of stack management system results in the loss of one mmx register 150 for general use. that is, one register ( register sp ) ideally is used to store the stack pointer instead of traditional data. accordingly, an alternate, preferred embodiment of the present invention maintains the virtual stack without using a stack pointer. instead, the top of the virtual stack is always a particular register such as register 0. fig3 a, 3b and 3 c illustrate such a virtual stack. in each of these figures, the top of the virtual stack is always register 0 although it could be any other register. a push or pop to the virtual stack results in an operation at register 0. for example, a push of data z onto the stack as shown in fig3 a will result in the data arrangement as shown in fig3 b. first, each data item presently existing in the stack as shown in fig3 a is moved by one register. that is, data item d is moved from register 3 to register 4. data item c is moved from register 2 to register 3. data item b is moved from register 1 to register 2 and data item a is moved from register 0 to register 1. after all existing data items have been moved, the new data item z is inserted into register 0. similarly, a pop results in the data item in register 0 being removed and the other data items being moved one register. for example, fig3 c represents the virtual data stack after a pop function is performed on the data as originally stored in fig3 a. the pop results in data item a being removed and data items b, c, and d being moved one register such that data item b is at the top of the virtual stack. because the number of mmx registers 150 within the mmx unit 145 is still relatively small, it is often more efficient to merely shift the data as a result of a push or pop rather than to use a stack pointer. similarly, because the number of mmx registers 150 is limited, it is often more efficient to execute a move instruction without testing to see if a register actually contains data. for example, a push of the data item z into the virtual stack as shown in fig3 a could result in a move instruction being executed for the data in register 6 to be moved to register 7 even though no data is actually contained in register 6. one skilled in the art, however, can readily recognize that error detection and other tests can easily be performed to avoid such moves and to avoid stack overflow. furthermore, in one embodiment of the present invention, the number of mmx registers 150 is increased by using both the lower 32 bits and the upper 32 bits of each of the 64 bit mmx registers 150. to efficiently use all 64 bits of the mmx registers 150, additional instructions can be added to the instruction set for the conventional mmx unit 145. for example, the instruction set can be expanded to include an instruction that allows movement of high order bits into low order bits ( through, for example, shifting ). in summary, one embodiment of the present invention overcomes the deficiencies in the existing systems by taking advantage of the fact that the mmx registers 150 are not used during post. instead of using these mmx registers 150 for their intended purpose, the present invention manipulates the mmx registers 150 and uses them as storage space for a virtual stack. this virtual stack can be configured to transfer data between itself and the general purpose registers 155. in particular, data is pushed onto the virtual stack by moving the existing data in the mmx registers 150 to the next higher numbered register and then placing the data to be saved in the lowest register. moreover, data is popped from the virtual stack by moving the data from the lowest number mmx register 150 into a general purpose register 155 and then moving the existing data in the mmx registers to the next lower numbered mmx register 150. additionally, a call can be simulated by pushing the return address onto the virtual stack and passing control to the called subroutine. the return is simulated by popping the return address into a general purpose register 155 and then jumping to that address. this method provides for nested routine calls up to the data storage limit of the mmx registers 150. those skilled in the art can readily recognize that numerous variations and substitutions may be made in the invention, its use and its configuration to achieve substantially the same results as achieved by the embodiments described herein. accordingly, there is no intention to limit the invention to the disclosed exemplary forms. many variations, modifications and alternative constructions fall within the scope and spirit of the disclosed invention as expressed in the claims.",a

"fig1 illustrates by way of example a circuit comprising a detector, constituted in this embodiment by two silicon pin photodiodes 1 and 3, together with other circuit elements forming a complete meter. in this particular embodiment of the invention the other elements comprise a capacitor 4 in series with the diode 1, a preamplifier 5 which is arranged to receive the combined output of the diodes 1 and 3, an amplifier 6, a threshold detector 7, and a counter and timer 8, the elements 5 to 8 constituting, in this embodiment, a means for indicating the rate of pulses which exceed a threshold. the counter may be coupled to a processing circuit 9, which in known manner may produce denoting the dose rate and the total dose and provide an alarm signal if either the dose rate or the dose exceeds a threshold. these signals may control respective sections of a display device 10 ( such as a liquid crystal display ). considering first the diode 1, which is preferably a silicon photodiode having an intrinsic layer between appropriately doped p and n regions, it will be understood that photon radiation incident on the diode can generate energetic electrons from photoelectric and compton interactions with the silicon crystal lattice. such electrons then lose energy by interaction with the crystal lattice and can generate electron - hole pairs within the intrinsic layer. the electrons thus generated are separated by the inherent field within the device to form a charge pulse which can be amplified by the preamplifier 5 and the amplifier 6. in this embodiment of the invention, if the charge pulse is in excess of said threshold as determined by the threshold detector 7, the pulse may be counted. although a device employing only a single pin diode in a self - biassing mode has some utility, it exhibits a response which is substantially non - uniform with variation in radiation energy and it is preferably to provide compensation by means of at least one further diode in order to obtain a combined output which is substantially uniform with variation of radiation energy. for this purpose the diode 1, which may be a bpx61 pin diode, is provided with means for attenuating incident radiation, preferably constituted by a brass cap, typically of the order of 2. 5 millimeters thick. the cap is schematically illustrated in fig1 by the dashed line 2. the provision of such a cap would normally result in a large underestimate for radiations of energy less than, for example, 150 kev. to compensate for this the output from a smaller diode 3 is added to that from the larger diode 1. the diode 3, which may be a bpx65 pin diode of which the glass lens is removed to improve the low energy response, may have, for example, approximately 14 % of the effectively sensitive area of the diode 1. in addition, a capacitor 4 may be disposed electrically in series with the diode 1 so as to reduce the signal amplitude from the diode 1. in this manner the falling output, from the larger diode, combined with the rising output, from the smaller diode, produces a response which is substantially uniform with respect to radiation energy. for the particular examples of diode as stated above, the capacitor may be a 180 pf capacitor. fig2 illustrates by way of example the physical arrangement of a meter 11 which is electrically arranged according to fig1. the diodes 1 and 3 may be incorporated into an integrated circuit 12, which contains all the detection, amplifying and processing stages of the device. the larger of the two diodes is covered by the brass shield 2. the two diodes should be mounted at least 6 mm apart to reduce shadowing by the brass shield 2 of the unshielded diode 3 from low energy radiation. the surface of the integrated circuit in which the diodes are incorporated faces away from the body of the wearer. the shield may comprise a disc which is mounted centrally over the diode 1 and is of significantly larger area than the active area of the diode 1. this configuration has in essence the same properties as the shield described with reference to fig1. the display 10, is preferably mounted in the top face of the meter for the sake of good visibility. if desired an audible alarm device 13 ( driven by the circuit 9 which is incorporated in the integrated circuit 12 ) may be disposed adjacent the display 10 and may be triggered by the alarm signal. a battery 14, preferably of sufficient capacity to last at least one year, may be disposed in a recess at the bottom of the meter. a detector as described may readily be arranged to provide a pulse output which at a suitable threshold is substantially independent of photon energy and angle of incidence for photons of energy greater than approximately 40 kev. such a device has a sensitivity suitable for employment of the device in an active personal dosemeter. a detector as described is capable of providing improved energy response and polar response with respect to known energy compensated geiger - muller tubes and offer further the advantages of robustness, consistency, cheapness of ease of manufacture and a more accurate background response, in addition to avoiding any need for high voltage electrical supplies",a radiation meter comprises two p - i - n photodiodes each disposed to operate in a self - biasing mode . the larger diode has an attenuating shield and the outputs of the diodes are combined . the invention is intended for active personal dose meters for the same general purpose as geiger - muller tubes .
"fig1 is a receiver panel unit 18 for the wireless safety control system. the receiver panel unit includes a multi - tap hook up terminal 20 for connecting a 120 - volt ac power source or a 12 - volt dc power source. all of the relays connected to the panel operate on 12 - volt dc. thus, a 120 - volt ac to 12 - volt dc transformer 22 is installed in each switch or panel to convert power provided at 120 - volt ac to 12 - volt dc so that the user can hook up to either power source without further action. the above features and others make the safety shut - off system herein one that may be packaged and marketed for others to install. a time delay off relay 24 is connected to the 12 - volt dc source and a switch 26 is provided to initiate contact with the relay 24. the signal received by a receiver 28 causes the time delay relay 24 to latch an internal solid state latching relay in the made position which causes the pump unit 34 to become and remain activated. upon latching, the time delay relay 24 starts timing off at an adjustable rate. one - hundred seconds would be a suitable time delay for the relay 24 to time off if a signal is not received by the time delay relay start switch 26. when a subsequent signal is received from a transmitter 30 by the switch 26, the relay 24 resets and begins timing again for one - hundred seconds. the one - hundred second time delay permits the system to miss receiving three consecutive signals from the transmitter 30 before the relay 24 will safety - off. the delay process and requirement for the system to miss three consecutive signals before latching off creates a very reliable safety system that does not incur false safety - off occurrences. the preferred embodiment of the invention uses a solid state device 24 that includes a latching relay and a time delay relay in one unit 24. the solid state time delay relay 24 operates on 12 volts dc and provides a reliable and cost - effective relay. the time delay relay 24 receives its input from an output relay 32 on the radio frequency receiver 28 that receives a signal from the remote transmitter 30. the receiver panel unit 18 further includes terminals 46 and 48 that connect to a starter of a pump unit 34 for automatic operation of the pump unit 34 or shut down circuitry of a diesel pump unit 34. should the receiver 28 not receive a signal from the transmitter 30 in the one - hundred seconds allotted by the time delay relay 24, the receiver panel 18 will provide an output and trigger the shut down of the pump unit 34. typically, an irrigation system will include an irrigation control panel 36 located on the pivot system tower near the pivot axis of the pivot system. as shown, the irrigation control panel 36 has a safety circuit 38 with terminals 50 and 52 located on the irrigation control panel 36. in the present invention, a transmitter switch panel 16 is connected to the irrigation control panel circuitry 36 and is powered by a 120 - volt ac current that is converted to 12 - volt dc. the transmitter switch panel 16 includes a repeat cycle solid state timer 42, labeled rc 1 in fig3 that operates on the 12 - volt dc current and repeats its clock cycle at an interval of time. in the preferred embodiment, the repeat cycle timer 42 provides an on input cycle for two seconds and then times for a thirty second delay before it sends another two second on input cycle signal. these time delays may be set according to the desired application settings. the inventor has found that setting the time delay for fifteen seconds rather than thirty may cause transmitter 30 to overheat because of the transmission frequency. as long as the transmitter switch panel 16 is receiving power from the irrigation system control panel 36, the on input signal will be generated periodically by the timer 42 and will be carried by the transmitter switch panel circuitry 16 to triggering relay contacts 44 on the transmitter 30 that is connected to the timer 42. the transmitter triggering contacts 44 are set to the normally open position. thus, when the on input signal is received by the transmitter 30, the transmitter contacts 44 close and send a latching signal to the receiver 28. fig4 and 5 represent a variation of the wireless safety control system of the present invention. the system depicted in fig4 and 5 provide additional improvements to the basic control system unit shown in fig1 and 3. in particular, the design illustrated in fig4 and 5 provides safeguards against false activation signals and isolates the wireless safety system controls from the existing controls on the irrigation system. the transmitter panel 54 of the irrigation safety control system shown in fig4 includes a three position switch 56. when the switch is turned left to a start position 58, the circuit causes the transmitter 60 to transmit a signal at a first channel selection, channel a, by closing the relay 62, labeled ch - a, on the circuit. in the preferred embodiment of the invention, channel a is set as channel one on the transmitter 60 and receiver 72. the receiver panel circuitry 70 of fig5 is configured such that a signal on channel a must be received for further operation. the switch 56 may be spring loaded when turned to the left start position 58 so that the switch 56 will automatically return to a middle or off position 64 when released. transmitting the signal on the first channel, channel a, to the receiver 72 latches a twenty ( 20 ) second time delay off relay 74, labeled td 1, located in the receiver panel 70 as shown in fig5. this gives the user twenty ( 20 ) seconds to turn the three position switch 56 to the right to a third position, which is the run position 66. the time delay of the time delay off relay 74 may be changed according to the users desired specifications. when the switch 56 is turned to the run position 66 a repeat cycle relay 68, labeled rc 1 in fig4 is activated on the transmitter panel 54 causing the auxiliary contacts 75 to close. the repeat cycle relay 68 causes the transmitter 60 to transmit a signal at a second channel selection, channel b, by closing the channel b transmitter contacts 76, labeled as ch - b, on the transmitter panel circuit 54 of fig4. in the preferred embodiment of the invention, channel b is set as channel four on the transmitter 60 and receiver 72. the channel b signal is activated by the repeat cycle relay 68 for two ( 2 ) seconds every thirty ( 30 ) seconds. the channel b signal cycle is repeated until the irrigation safety control system is turned off or until the safety circuit 38 on the irrigation system pivot control box is kicked out. as shown in fig5 when the receiver 72 receives a channel a signal and contacts 96 are closed, the internal switch 94 of time delay off relay 74 is activated and gives the user twenty seconds to turn the switch 56 to the run position 66 and cause the channel b signal to be transmitted to the receiver 72. during the twenty seconds that the time delay off relay 74 is energized and latched, the contacts 78 of the time delay relay 74 will be closed. if the channel b signal is not received by the receiver 72, the receiver panel 70 will not provide activation of the irrigation pump unit 34. however, if the channel b signal is received by the receiver 72, then the channel b contacts 100 are closed and an internal switch 98 is activated and latches a one - hundred second time delay off relay 80, labeled as td 2. the time delay of the second time delay off relay 80 may be varied according to the users desired settings and the timing of the repeat cycle relay 68 that causes the transmitter 60 to send a signal to the receiver 72. latching the time delay relay 80 activates the control relay 82, labeled as co 1, and closes the contacts 102. as the time delay off relay 80 is timing off for one - hundred seconds, the transmitter 60 is sending channel b signals to the receiver 72 every thirty ( 30 ) seconds as regulated by the repeat cycle relay 68. every time the receiver 72 receives the channel b signal time delay off relay 80 resets at one - hundred seconds and begins timing off again. time delay off relay 74 will time out at the end of 20 seconds, but time delay relay 80 will stay energized because relay 82 is latching the time delay off relay 80 at contacts 90. therefore, the receiver 72 will continue to operate until channel b signals are no longer received. the receiver 72 may miss a two signals before the time delay off relay 80 will time out and cause the system shut off. while energized, the relay 82 holds closed a remotely mounted control relay 84, labeled as co 2, through isolated contacts 86 on the control relay 82. dry contacts 88 on the control relay 84 are used to operate the pump unit 34. when channel b signals stop, the time delay off relay 80 will time out and relays 82 and 84 will de - energize causing the isolated contacts 86 and contacts 88 on the control relays 82 and 84 to open and cause the pumping unit 34 to stop. in the embodiment disclosed, the receiver 28 is the model xr - 1 receiver and receiver 72 is the model xr - 4 receiver. both preferred receivers are manufactured by linear corporation. the companion transmitters 30 or 60 are the models xt - 1 and xt - 4, respectively, also manufactured by linear corporation. the xr -

"identifiable structures and systems and methods for fabricating the identifiable structure are provided. embodiments of this disclosure relate to the three - dimensional objects and fabrication thereof, where one or more identifiable structures are disposed within and / or on the surface of three - dimensional objects. in particular, the three - dimensional object including the identifiable structure can be fabricated using solid freeform fabrication ( sff ) systems and methods. the term three - dimensional object refers to objects that are sufficiently rigid to maintain a fixed volume and shape to an extent, which is appropriate for use in sff systems. the term identifiable structure refers to a structure that can be identified using noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging devices or exploratory devices. in addition, the identifiable structure is fabricated so that it provides information ( e. g., identifying, quantitative, and / or qualitative information ) about the three - dimensional object that can be detected using noninvasive dimensional penetrating devices. additional details regarding the three - dimensional object and the identifiable structure are described in more detail below. in general, the identifiable structure is disposed within and / or upon the surface of the three - dimensional object to provide information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to convey, determine, or detect without invasive action and / or harming action to the three - dimensional object and / or the subject ( e. g., animal, human, etc. ) that the three - dimensional object is disposed within. for example, a bone replacement can be fabricated to include an identifiable structure disposed therein. the identifiable structure can be detected using a noninvasive x - ray technique, for example. for example, the identifiable structure can represent a bar code and / or letters, numbers, symbols, etc., that can be read off of the x - ray and used to identify features ( e. g., date created, manufacturer, etc. ) of the bone replacement. in addition or alternatively, the identifiable structure can include dimensional, orientation, and / or alignment features that could be useful for evaluating the bone replacement without invasive surgery. currently, bone identification information can only be accessed using invasive surgery. in some embodiments the identifiable structure is disposed within the three - dimensional object. by including the identifiable structure within the three - dimensional object, the material that the identifiable structure is constructed of does not have to be compatible with the material ( e. g., body fluids, tissue, etc. ) located on the exterior of the three - dimensional object, thereby protecting the information contained in the identifiable structure from harmful environments and / or protecting the material on the exterior of the three - dimensional object from the identifiable structure. in another embodiment the identifiable structure is disposed within a security device such as a key card. the identifiable structure can be made of a magnetic material, for example, that the can be identified by the noninvasive dimensional penetrating device or detecting device. for example, the identifiable structure can be designed ( e. g., shaped ) so that the identifiable structure is distinguishable from other key cards. the three - dimensional structure can include, but is not limited to, bone replacements ( e. g., joint replacements ), dental structures ( e. g., dental caps ), a portion of a medical device disposed within the body of a subject, and a security item ( e. g., located within a security key or card, within a credit card, or some other security device ). the identifiable structure can include one or more structures that provide information about the three dimensional object such as, but not limited to, one or more structures that define a code ( e. g., bar code ), one or more structures that define a signature or identification marking ( e. g., words, letters, symbols that identify a manufacturer, a date of creation, a part identification, a reference mark, a unique shape, and a pattern ), one or more structures that define the orientation of the three - dimensional object with respect to itself or another object, one or more structures that define alignment features of the three - dimensional object with respect to itself or another object, one or more structures that define the dimensional relationship ( e. g., distance in the x -, y -, and / or z - axis ) of the three - dimensional object with respect to itself or another object, one or more structures that define textures ( shading ) within the three - dimensional object, one or more optical structures that after being embedded within the three - dimensional structure can be identified using the noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device, one or more structures ( e. g., adjacent one another or one structure embedded with another structure ) made of different materials and identified using the same or different noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging devices, one or more structures that define a symbol, icon, emblem, logo, sign, etc, that identifies or otherwise indicates information about the three - dimensional object or a relationship between the three - dimensional object and another object, and combinations thereof. the identifiable structure can include a structure made from one or more contrast enhancing materials dispensed into an area and viewable with the noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device. in addition, the identifiable structure can include a structure having a void or cavity within the structure, where the void or cavity ( e. g., an air - gap ) defines one or more structures communicating the information as described above. in one embodiment, the contrast between the contrast enhancing material and / or the build material, and the air - gap can be viewed by the noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device. initially, the void can be filled with a material ( e. g., a polymer ) that can be caused to substantially decompose thereby forming the void. in another embodiment, the void can be filled with a second contrast enhancing agent or other material ( e. g., build material ) that can be contrasted with the contrasting material and viewed using the noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device. the identifiable structure can be one dimensional or multidimensional. the dimensions ( e. g., thickness, length, and width ) of the identifiable structure can be from a few nanometers to many micrometers limited by the resolution of the imaging technology / machine and the size of the three - dimensional object, for example. in addition, the dimensions of the identifiable structure depend, at least in part, upon the contrast enhancing material being used, the material surrounding the identifiable structure, the noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device, the technique used to make the identifiable structure, and the information conveyed using the identifiable structure. fig1 illustrates a block diagram of a representative sff system 10 that includes a computer control system 12 and a layer forming system 14. the layer forming system 14 includes, but is not limited to, a dispensing system 16 and a curing system 18. the curing system 18 can include a conventional curing system ( e. g., an ultraviolet or visible radiation curing system ). the computer control system 12 includes a process control system that is operative to control the dispensing system 16 and the curing system 18. in addition, the computer control system 12 includes, but is not limited to, a computer aided design ( cad ) system or other ssf cad - related systems. the dispensing system 16 includes, but is not limited to, conventional ink - jet technologies, conventional coating technologies, and future ink - jet / coating technologies, which dispense a build material or precursor components thereof that form the three - dimensional object. in addition, the dispensing system is adapted to dispense the contrast enhancing material or precursor components into defined portions to form the identifiable structure. it should be noted that the build material or precursor components thereof and contrast enhancing material or precursor components could be dispensed sequentially or at the same time from the same or different dispensing heads. ink - jet technology, such as drop - on - demand and continuous flow ink - jet technologies, can be used to dispense build material, contrast enhancing materials, or precursor components of each onto a build platform and layers of material formed thereon. the dispensing system 16 can include at least one conventional ink - jet printhead ( e. g., thermal ink - jet printhead and / or a piezo ink - jet print head ) operative to dispense ( e. g., jet ) the build material, contrast enhancing materials, or precursor components of each through one or more of a plurality of ink - jet printhead dispensers. alternatively, the build material, contrast enhancing materials, or precursor components of each could be disposed onto one or more layers of the build material using other automated or manual techniques. the build material can include one or more components known in the art such as, but not limited to, build materials, initiators, colorants ( e. g., dyes, pigments, inks ), and dispersants. in addition, the dispensing system 16 can include a contrast enhancing material. the contrast enhancing material can include materials that can be detected using noninvasive dimensional penetrating devices such as, but not limited to, x - ray devices, magnetic imaging devices, computerized axial tomography ( cat ) scan devices, ultrasound devices, and computerized topography devices. the contrast enhancing material can include, but is not limited to, metal containing compounds, metal and / or metal composite micro - and / or nano - particles, and combinations thereof. in particular, the contrast enhancing material can include metal containing compounds such as, but not limited to, bismuth, silver, lead, iron ( ferrous material ), and combinations thereof. further, the contrast enhancing material can include micro - and / or nano - particles of metals ( e. g., silver, lead, and / or bismuth nano - particles ), metal composites, and / or metal oxides. it should be noted that the micro - and / or nano - particles have diameters in the range so that the dispensing system does not become clogged while dispensing. in one embodiment the particle size can be about 10 to 20 % of the orifice size. in another embodiment the particle size can be about 15 to 20 % of the drop size. for example, with a 5 picoliter drop volume, the drop size is about 15 - 20 micrometers. this suggests a particle size 15 to 20 % of that dimension. another factor to consider is the solid loading, which for thermal inkjets is less than about 5 % and for piezo inkjet drop content is less than about 15 %. in addition, the micro - and / or nano - particles are suspended in a solution. in addition, the contrast enhancing material can include, but is not limited to, a colorant ( e. g., carbon black ). the colorant can include, but is not limited to, optical dyes and pigments, and combinations thereof. in another embodiment, the contrast enhancing material can include contrast media such as x - ray contrast media and magnetic resonance contrast media. x - ray contrast media are used to alter the contrast in x - rays ( e. g., increase or decrease the attenuation of the x - rays ). positive x - ray contrast media increase the attenuation of the x - rays and can include, but are not limited to, iodinated contrast media and barium contrast media. iodinated contrast media can include, but are not limited to, water insoluble iodinated media ( e. g., propyliodone compounds ), oily contrast media ( e. g., lipiodol compounds and iodophenyllundecyclic compounds mixed in an oil ), and water soluble iodinated media ( e. g., mono - / poly - iodinated pyridone compounds and tri - iodinated benzene ring compounds ( monomeric - / dimeric ) ). magnetic resonance contrast media can include positive and negative contrast media. positive contrast magnetic resonance media can include small molecular weight compounds containing gadolinium ( gd ), manganese ( mn ), and iron ( fe ), superparamagnetic contrast media, and perfluorinated contrast media. for example, the media can include, but is not limited to, gadopentate meglumine compounds, gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, ferric ammonium citrate, gadoxetic acid, diphenylcyclohexyl phosphodiester, manganese substituted hydroxylapatite peg - apd and the like. negative contrast magnetic resonance media include, but are not limited to, sprodyamide, ferrum oxide, carboxy - dextran coated iron oxide nanoparticles, micro - / poly - crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, perfluorooctylbromide, barium suspensions and clay mineral particles, and the like. in one embodiment, the particle size is less than about 300 nanometers. additional compounds can be found at http : / / www. amershamhealth. com / medcyclopaedia. in another embodiment, the contrast enhancing material could be part of and / or combined with the build material, binder material, and / or other components used to fabricate the three - dimensional object. in another embodiment, two different contrast enhancing materials can be used, where the two contrast enhancing materials can be viewed using the same or different noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging device. the two different contrast enhancing materials can be used to make one or more identifiable structures ( e. g., adjacent or embedded within one another ). for example, one identifiable structure can be embedded within another identifiable structure, where each identifiable structure is made of a different contrast enhancing material each of which can be viewed using different noninvasive dimensional penetrating imaging devices. it should also be noted that the density or concentration of the contrast enhancing material in a designated area can be controlled by the number of passes of the dispensing system over the designated area ( e. g., more passes over the designated area equals higher concentration in the designated area ). it should also be noted that this can be done without performing a planing pass and amounts to performing multiple passes to build up the concentration. the sff system 10 can be incorporated into processes that are used to fabricate or construct three - dimensional objects having identifiable structures disposed therein, in an iterative layered process on a support ( e. g., a structure used to support a region of the three - dimensional object while it is being fabricated ). the computer control system 12 is capable of being selectively adjusted to control the output from the dispensing system 16, which controls the thickness and pattern of each component in each layer of the iterative process. additional details regarding the layers of the three - dimensional object are discussed below. the sff system 10 can include a planing system that uses a planing device to normalizes the height of one or more of the layers of the three - dimensional object after the layer is formed. the planing device ( e. g., heated or unheated ) normalize the height of the layers of materials to a predetermined height or thickness. an example of a planing device includes a pre - heated rotating planarizer that passes over each layer after the layer has been formed. in particular, the pre - heated cylindrical roller ( planarizer ) is precisely passed over each layer and locally melts a portion of the build material and / or the contrast enhancing material of the layer. some of the build material and / or the contrast enhancing material adheres to the surface of the planarizer as it rolls to thereby normalize the layer to conform to the desired thickness. a wiping or scraping device such as a blade can be used to peel or skive off the excess build material and / or the contrast enhancing material from the planarizer. it should be noted that after planing the layers, the layer could be cured. in general, the layers can be cured by full exposure or by scan exposing. to enhance layer - to - layer adhesion, it may be useful to only partially cure each layer during the fabrication process. a full cure could be accomplished by placing the object in a light box after removal from the fabrication tool. in addition, the curing process can be performed after the layers are disposed on a build platform ( e. g., flood exposure or scan exposure ). furthermore, the curing process can be performed in a substantially contemporaneous manner by scan exposing the build material and / or the contrast enhancing material as the material is dispensed. fig2 is a flow diagram describing a representative method 20 for forming a three - dimensional object having an identifiable structure disposed therein, using the sff system 10. in block 22, the contrast enhancing material is provided. as mentioned above, the dispensing system 16 includes one or more containers to hold the contrast enhancing material as well as the build material. in block 24, the contrast enhancing material is disposed in a layer - by - layer fashion onto the designated areas, which are defined by the dimensions of the identifiable structure, while the build material is disposed onto the remaining areas of the partially formed three - dimensional object. the computer control system 12 in conjunction with the layer forming system 14 controls the dispensing of the contrast enhancing material. as each layer of the contrast enhancing material and build material is disposed, each layer is planed. alternatively, the planning can occur after a plurality of layers is formed. in block 26, the plurality of layers of contrast enhancing material forms the identifiable structure. subsequently, additional layers of build material are disposed to form the remaining portions of the three - dimensional object having the identifiable structure disposed therein, as shown in block 28. fig3 illustrates a representative cross - section of a three - dimensional object 100 having three identifiable structures disposed thereon. prior to forming the three - dimensional object 100, the layer forming system 14 divides the three - dimensional object 100 into a plurality of cross - sectional layers. each layer can be further divided into shell voxels ( s ) ( e. g., an exterior layer and / or another layer disposed within the interior of the three - dimensional object ), interior voxels ( i ), and identifiable structure voxels ( a voxels, b voxels, and c voxels ). in general, the shell voxels and the interior voxels are made of the same material. however, the shell voxels and the interior voxels can be made of the same or different material. the distinction between shell voxel and interior voxel is the location on the each voxel, as illustrated in fig3. the shell voxel is defined as an area within a certain distance in the x -, y -, and z - directions of transition between the voxel and air, and layer and support. in other words, the shell voxel represents the exterior side portions of the three - dimensional object 100. the identifiable structure voxels include discrete areas in the x -, y -, and / or z - directions of the three - dimensional object, while the interior voxels includes the remaining inside areas of the three - dimensional object 100. the identifiable structure layers form the identifiable structures represented by the a & # 39 ; s, b & # 39 ; s, and c & # 39 ; s. fig4 a illustrates a cross -

section of the base layer 102, the first layer 104, and the second layer 106, where a third layer 108 is formed on the second layer 106. the third layer 108 includes shell voxels and interior voxels. in some embodiments the third layer 108 can include a plurality of layers that ultimately form the three -

section of the base layer 112, the first layer 114, and the second layer 116, where a third layer 118 is formed on the second layer 116. the third layer 118 includes shell voxels and interior voxels. in some embodiments the third layer 118 can include a plurality of layers that ultimately form the three - dimensional object 100. fig6 a illustrates a cross - section of a base layer of a three - dimensional object 100 shown in fig3 though the c - c cross - section. the base layer 122 is formed on a build platform and includes the shell voxels and the interior voxels. in some embodiments the base layer 122 can include a plurality of layers having various geometric cross - sections as defined by the three - dimensional object to be formed. fig6 b illustrates a cross - section of the base layer 122 having a first layer 124 formed thereon. the first layer 122 includes shell voxels, interior voxels, identifiable structure voxels b, and identifiable structure voxels c. the identifiable structure voxels b are formed in the y -

"as an embodiment of a vehicle control device according to the present invention, for example, a case wherein the present invention is applied to an engine control device will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. fig1 is a view showing the arrangement of an embodiment according t o the present invention. referring to fig1 an engine control device 1 comprises a cpu 10 for various arithmetic operations and processes, a prom ( nonvolatile ) 11 serving as an electrically erasable / writable storage means in which a control program or data is loaded on the cpu 10 to perform the arithmetic operations and processes, a mask rom 12, which is disabled from being erased / written, in which an updating process program for updating the prom 11 is stored, a ram 13 for writing or reading data which is arithmetically operated and processed by the cpu 10, an i / o 14 for receiving input signals from various sensors or outputting various control signals, and a switching circuit 15 for selecting the updating process program stored in the mask rom 12 and the control program stored in the prom 11 on the basis of an updating signal 2a from an updating device 2 ( to be described later ) serving as an external device. the updating device 2 incorporates an updating program 20 and a program for controlling this device. the mask rom 12 of the engine control device 1 receives the updating program 20 incorporated in the updating device 2 through the switching circuit 15, the cpu 10, and a serial communication line 2c to store an updating process program for updating the prom 11. a serial communication line 2b is used when the cpu 10 checks the updating device 2 to determine whether the receiving operation is correctly performed, when a control signal is transmitted to the updating device 2, or the like. a crank angle signal 14a for measuring an engine speed and an intake air amount signal 14b for measuring an amount of air taken in an engine are input to the i / o 14, a fuel injection amount to the engine is arithmetically operated by the cpu 10 on the basis of these input signals, and a control amount depending on the arithmetic result is output as a fuel injection control signal 14c through the i / o 14. the cpu 10, the prom 11, the mask rom 12, the ram 13, the i / o 14, and the switching circuit 15 are connected to each other through address / data buses. a control program required for engine control is stored in the prom 11, and the prom 11 can perform an electrically erasing / writing operation. however, when the updating signal 2a is not input from the external updating device 2, the prom 11 serves as a read - only rom which cannot perform an erasing / writing operation. when the updating signal 2a is input, the prom 11 serves as a rom which can perform an erasing / writing operation. the cpu 10, the mask rom 12, the switching circuit 15, and the updating device 2 constitutes an updating process means. fig2 is a memory map showing address allocation for a memory included in the engine control device 1 in this embodiment. in fig2 memory areas are arranged in ascending order of addresses from the top. more specifically, a memory area 30 for various registers for switching the functions in the cpu 10, a memory area 31 for the ram 13, a memory area 32 for the mask rom 12 for storing an updating process program, a memory area 33 serving as a first memory area for the prom 11 for storing a control program required for engine control, and a reset vector area 33a serving as a second memory area which is a part of the memory area 33 are sequentially arranged from the top. upon completion of reset releasing, the cpu 10 loads an address designated by the reset vector area 33a, and the control program is executed and processed from the designated address. an updating process for the prom 11 will be described below with reference to fig3 to 6. fig3 is a flow chart showing the processes of the updating process program stored in the mask rom 12 and executed when the updating signal 2a is input from the updating device 2 to the engine control device 1. referring to fig3 various initial settings for the processes are performed in step s11, and a serial communication ( sci ) mode for receiving an updating command from the updating device 2 and the updating program 20 incorporated in this device, sending a reply to the command, or the like is performed in step s12. in step s13, an external communication signal is received, a reception interrupt wait state for performing an interrupt process is set. fig4 is a chart showing a communication sequence between the engine control device 1 and the updating device 2 which are used for an updating process. fig5 is a flow chart showing processes executed by sci interrupt occurring when a communication signal such as a command from the updating device 2 is received. referring to fig4 when the updating signal 2a from the updating device 2 is on - output in step s21, the engine control device 1 sets an updating process mode in step s31. more specifically, when the updating signal 2a is on - output, the prom 11 is enabled to perform an erasing / writing operation, a switching operation to the updating process program stored in the mask rom 12 is performed by the switching circuit 15, and the cpu 10 executes the processes of the flow chart shown in fig3 and then is set in an sci interrupt wait state, i. e., a command wait state. when the updating device 2 transmits an erasing command for erasure in step 22, the engine control device 1 executes an erasing process in step s32 ( erasing means ). more specifically, when the cpu 10 receives an erase command, the sci interrupt process shown in fig5 is executed. if & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; is not yes in step s41, an erase command is recognized in step s44, contents of the prom ( nonvolatile memory ) 11 is erased in step s45, and the recent interrupt process is completed in step s46. when the updating device 2 transmits a write command for a writing operation in step s23 in fig4 the engine control device 1 prepares the writing process in step s33 ( first writing means ), and writes first write data d1, which may be referred to as a part of a control program to be written first, and transmits d1 in a predetermined format in the prom 11. here, the write data d1 corresponds to data stored in a memory area other than the reset vector area 33a of the memory map in fig2 i. e., the memory area 33. more specifically, when the cpu 10 receives the write command, the sci interrupt process ( fig5 ) is executed, the cpu 10 recognizes the write command in step s50, and the cpu 10 sets the & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; to yes. at this time, & # 34 ; count 1 & # 34 ; of a counter ( not shown ) included in the cpu 10 for measuring the write data number in the writing process is set to 0, and the recent interrupt is temporarily ended in step s52. when write data transmitted after the write command, the sci interrupt process ( fig5 ) is executed again, and the & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; is checked in step s41 serving as the first step. however, since & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; is set to yes during the previous sci interrupt process, & # 34 ; in - writing flag = yes & # 34 ; is determined in step s41, and a writing process ( step s42 ) is executed. the detailed process of the writing process in step s42 will be described below with reference to fig6 showing the flow chart of the writing process. as write data, & # 34 ; write all data number ( n ) & # 34 ; + & # 34 ; write start address & # 34 ; + & # 34 ; write data d1 & # 34 ; +. . . + & # 34 ; write data dn & # 34 ; are transmitted in this order. referring to fig6 at an address of the prom 11 obtained by adding the value of count 1 set to zero in step s51 to the & # 34 ; write start address & # 34 ; transmitted secondly in step s61, & # 34 ; write data d1 & # 34 ; which is transmitted thirdly is written. the value of count 1 is incremented in step s62, the value of count 1 is compared with & # 34 ; write all data number n & # 34 ; transmitted first in step s63. until the value of count 1 reaches & # 34 ; write data number n & # 34 ;, i. e., until all the data are completely written, the above process is repeated every time the write data is received. in this manner, & # 34 ; write data & # 34 ; transmitted thirdly, fourthly,. . . , are sequentially written in the prom 11. if it is determined in step s63 that all the data are completely written, the & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; is set to no in step s64 to end the writing process. the & # 34 ; in - writing flag & # 34 ; is set to no for the following reason. that is, next reception data is determined to be no in step s41 of the sci interrupt process ( fig5 ) executed when the data is received, and the next reception data is recognized as a next command. returning to fig4 when the updating device 2 transmits a checksum transmission command to request a checksum in step s24, the engine control device 1 calculates the checksum and transmits the result in step s34. more specifically, when the cpu 10 receives a checksum transmission command, the sci interrupt process ( fig5 ) is executed, the cpu 10 recognizes a checksum command in step s47, and data in all the areas of prom 11 is added in step s48. after the total value ( checksum ) is calculated, the result is transmitted to the updating device 2, and the recent interrupt process is ended in step s49. steps s25, s26, and s27 shown in fig4 and processed by the updating device 2 are the characteristic features of this embodiment. first, the checksum which has been transmitted is calculated in advance in step s25 ( collation means ), and the value of the checksum collates with the design value of the stored checksum. when the collation results coincide with each other, the same writing process as that in steps s23 and s33 described above is performed to write data d2 in steps s27 and s35 ( second write means ). the updating signal 2a is turned off in step s28 to end all the updating processes, and the engine control device 1 receives the off updating signal 2a to end all the updating processes. here, the updating signal 2a is the contents of the minimum control program which is required to cause the engine control device 1 to arithmetically process a normal control amount, and corresponds to data stored in the reset vector area 33a of the memory map in fig2. on the other hand, when collation results do not coincide with each other in step s25, after the updating device 2 displays writing defect in step s26, the process in step s28 described above is performed to end all the updating processes. when the updating lines ( serial communication lines 2b and 2c ) are instantaneously cut off in the above processes, e. g., in the middle of writing the first write data d1, the checksum collation results do not coincide with each other in step s25. because the intended normal data is not written in the reset vector area 33a, the areas not written stay in the state as they were when the erasing process was executed ( all & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; ) in step s32. as a result, an address at which execution of the control program is started is not normally designated after the cpu 10 releases the reset state, and the engine control device 1 will therefore output an apparently abnormal control amount. referring to fig5 when the signal transmitted from the updating device 2 does not correspond to any one of signals in steps s41, s44, s47, and s50, an error sent back to the updating device 2 in step s53, the interrupt process is ended in step s54. in reception of the error reply, although not shown, for example, the updating device 2 can also perform the same process as that performed when the checksums do not coincide with each other in step s25. in this embodiment, an updating process means for updating a control program stored in an electrically programmable nonvolatile memory into an updating program stored in an external updating device is arranged, the updating process means erases the program in the nonvolatile memory and then performs a writing process to the first memory area, i. e., the memory area 33. only when the writing process is correctly executed, a writing process is executed to the second memory area, i. e., the reset vector area 33a, in which the minimum control program which is required to cause the control device to arithmetically process a normal control amount. for this reason, the control program can be updated without removing the nonvolatile memory, i. e., a rom. in addition, when writing defect occurs due to some factor, after data in the memory is erased, part of the control program first written is in the memory. thereafter, only when the part of the control program first written is correctly written, the remaining part ( i. e., the minimum part of the control program which is required to normally operate the control device ) is written. more specifically, if the part of the control program intended to be written first cannot be correctly written, the remaining part ( i. e., the minimum control program required to normally operate the control device ) is not written. for this reason, the writing defect can be easily detected in the step following the updating step, and defective products can be prevented from being issued to the market. embodiment 1 has described a case wherein the reset vector area 33a is used as a remaining part of the control program ( write data d2 ) ( i. e., an area in which the minimum control program which is required to cause the engine control device to arithmetically process a normal control amount ). however, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and, as the above remaining part designated in the memory area 33a, a vector address area for designating a jump destination when various interrupts such as the sci occur may be used. in embodiment 1, fuel injection control, which is typical of engine controls, has been described. however, an input / output signal may also perform ignition control and idling speed control for controlling an amount of air for idling. furthermore, in embodiment 1, a case in which the present invention is applied to an engine control device has been described. however, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement, and the present invention can also be similarly applied to other vehicle control devices such as a transmission control device and a power steering control device.","a vehicle control device has an prom with a first and second memory area . the contents of the prom are updated by erasing locations for a vehicle control program , writing part of the vehicle control program into the prom , checking for abnormalities in the writing process , and then writing the remaining part of the vehicle control program into the prom only when the result of writing the part first is determined not to have been abnormal . this determination may be based on a checksum , of the program codes that were expected to have been written into the first memory area as the first part of the vehicle control program , compared with the checksum of the program codes actually written . in the event of an

. the remaining part of the vehicle control program is a part of the program necessary for proper functioning , such as the reset vector . if the reset vector of the vehicle control program is used as the remaining part , and the remaining part is not written due to the detection of an abnormality , then any attempt to execute the abnormally updated control program will result in performance that is manifestly abnormal and easy to detect in subsequent production steps ."
"fig1 a and 1b each show a top plan view of a shield or visor 1, which usually protects the face, which can be detachably or undetachably connected to a helmet, a mask or generally a head covering ( not shown ). the visor 1 comprises a transparent plate 2, which is bent in fig1 a and 1b, generally a two - or three - dimensionally bent plate, which plate, when used on a helmet, will usually be made of a flexible, transparent plastic, such as polycarbonate, by thermal molding or injection - molding. the plate 2 has an inner side 3, which faces towards the helmet or the user, and an outer side 4. in the embodiment that is shown in fig1 a, a recess 5 has been formed in the outer side 4, the depth of said recess being equal to the thickness of the layer 6 of a light - sensitive material ( yet to be explained hereinafter ), so that the surface at the front side of the visor 1 is flat, which reduces the occurrence of local turbulence which may be accompanied by objectionable whistling sounds or noise while riding. if desired, the layer 6 may merge into a sun visor in the outward direction. when the polycarbonate is being injection - molded, the pre - formed layer of material 6 can be melted in place in the recess 5. the advantage of this is that no water or moisture can penetrate between the various layers, which are thus closely packed together, but that there will be no trapped air bubbles, either, so that light can reach the eye without any optical interference. the recess is preferably limited to an effective field of vision or viewing portion of the plate 2. if desired, a motorcyclist can look past said portion when there is not enough light available temporarily, for example upon driving into a tunnel. in the embodiment of fig1 b, too, the layer 6 of light - sensitive material is permanently provided on the outer side 4 of the transparent plate 2. in this embodiment the layer 6 of material, which preferably has a minimum thickness of only 0. 5 mm, has been applied to the plate 2 during or after the injection - molding process, in the latter case by means of a suitable vacuum technique. in view of the cost price of the light - sensitive material, which material will be explained hereinafter, the dimensions of the layer 6 of material will be limited to those of the field of vision or viewing portion of the plate 2. suitable ways of permanently combining the plate 2 and the layer 6 are : injection molding or casting, thermal molding, gluing or laminating. as regards said laminating, the photosensitive material may also be laminated between two transparent layers of plastic material, preferably polycarbonate. usually this takes place by means of a combination of a thermal treatment and a pressure treatment, followed by a treatment in a furnace so as to realize the desired two - or three - dimensional shape. said sandwich will have a thickness of about 0. 5 mm in that case, comprising two polycarbonate layers each having a thickness of 0. 2 mm, between which a laminate or glue is provided in a thickness of 0. 1 mm. in this way very little of the costly photosensitive material is used in the intermediate layer, which is advantageous. fig2 a, 2 b and the detail of fig2 c show embodiments in which the layer 6 of photosensitive material, possibly in the form of a laminate or a film, is detachably provided on the outer side 4 of the transparent plate 2. the visor 1 is provided with fastening means 7 in that case, for example in the form of a clamp, tension, snap, clip, pin, or magnet fastening system, or of single - or double - sided adhesive means. an example of this is shown in fig2 a, in which velcro 7 is affixed to the plate 2 and the layer 6 of photosensitive material. in the embodiment of fig2 b, this manner of attachment is combined with a snap connection 7 - 1, 7 - 2 as shown in more detail in fig2 c, which is connected or molded to the layer 6 and which makes it possible to detach the layer 6 from the plate 2. in an embodiment that is not shown in the figures, the embodiment of fig2 a is provided with velcro in several places, and holes may have been formed both in the plate 2 and in the layer 6, if desired, for receiving the pins, thus making it possible to detach the layer 6 from the plate 2. the plate 2 may in turn be detachable or pivotable with respect to the helmet, as the embodiment of fig3 a ( yet to be explained ) shows. important is in any case that the layer which comprises the photosensitive material is detachable and that the layer 6 can be secured to the plate 2 with sufficient mechanical tension. to that end clamping means may be provided, which may be eccentric and rotatable, for example, and to which the layer 6 is connected, which layer can subsequently be pulled tight on the plate 6 under tension, for example by rotating a pin. fig3 a and 3b are top plan views of two embodiments of the visor 1, in which the layer 6 of photosensitive material is kept spaced from the transparent plate 2 by a short distance by means of pins 7 - 3 and 7 - 4 ( fig3 a ). present between the plate 2 and the layer 6, in particular round the pins 7 - 3 and 7 - 4, is an elastic element 8, for example in the form of a ring, which, in compressed condition, exerts a pressure on the plate 2 and the layer 6, thus ensuring water - tightness around the pins. the element 8, which functions as a spacer between the transparent plate 2 and the photosensitive layer 6, is preferably configured as a dry, non - adhesive, flexible silicone seal which may extend over at least part, possibly even the whole, of the circumferential edges of the photosensitive layer 6. this achieves that the visor 1 is water - tight all around, whilst the flexible seal prevents the occurrence of mechanical point loads by distributing the tensions. in the embodiment that is shown in fig3 a, separable pins, i. e. pins that can be detached from each other, for example configured with male and corresponding female connecting elements, make it possible to detach the layer 6 from the plate 2. the flexible, dry, transparent element 8 prevents the ingress of air, water, moisture and dirt in that case and prevents the plate 2 and the layer 6 from moving undesirably relative to each other under the influence of the wind when driving. in the embodiment that is shown in fig3 b, the layer 6 is detachably provided on an extension 9 of the transparent plate 2. the element 8, which forms a practically cured silicone seal in that case, on the one hand maintains a certain spacing between the plate 2 and the layer 6 in that case, also when the wind exerts a pressure force on the layer 6 when driving, whilst on the other hand said element 8 thus prevents the plate 2 and the layer 6 from flapping and beating together, so that there will be no damage and / or wear. the use of the silicone seal furthermore prevents the occurrence of so - called newton rings. in the case of the non - permanent, i. e. detachable or removable variants it is generally not necessary to buy a new helmet or a new visor and nevertheless benefit from the light - sensitivity. after all, the existing helmet may be fitted with a new visor exhibiting the light - sensitive characteristic, or the old visor may be exchanged for the new visor temporarily or permanently. not only does this have a cost - saving effect, but it also leads to less wear, because it is possible in that case to use the new visor only in situations in which the rider considers this necessary in view of the weather conditions. possibly, a permanent layer of light - sensitive material may be provided once - only on the visor 1 by means of foam or acrylic tape in the field of vision of an existing visor 1. the light - sensitive, in particular uv - sensitive layer 6 comprises ( photochromatic ) pigments, which have the property that they are photosensitive and regulate the amount of light transmitted, especially uv light, in dependence on the amount of visible light and / or uv light incident thereon. in that case the layer 6 is transparent in unexposed, deactivated condition. in particular uv light - intensity - activated, light - blocking pigments are commercially available. for example, to form the layer 6, a pigment mixed with a suitable liquid is applied to a transparent substrate or is integral with the substrate itself, or a pigment - containing film is glued to the substrate, or the pigment or pigment mixture is mixed with the glue itself in a laminating process. the properties of the layer 6 of photosensitive material to be finally obtained must meet the stringent european public road safety regulations. a pigment which is suitable for use in the visor 1 is a so - called base grey pigment, which consists of three mixed base color, light - sensitive pigments. in non - uv - activated condition the light transmission thereof is at least 90 %, and it meets all the safety regulations for a safe use also at night or when unexpectedly driving into a badly lit or unlit tunnel. the pigment layer that regulates the transmission of light above 380 nm is preferably minimally 0. 1 mm thick, it may for example be sandwiched between two polycarbonate layers, each preferably having a thickness of minimally 0. 1 mm. polycarbonate is easy to extrude and process in an injection - molding process. the layer 6 of light - sensitive material thus built up of three layers is easy to form to precisely the required dimensions and shape. this may be done mechanically, but also by the aforesaid thermal molding, using heat and pressure. it stands to reason that combination possibly with other plastics in a laminating - bonding process is possible, in which case the pigment powder is mixed in an amount that matches the desired light - blocking specifications and which, for cost - saving reasons, will be provided only in the field of vision or viewing portion of the visor 1. on the outer side, the visor 1 may be provided with a, preferably water - repellent, anti - scratch film applied to the outer side of the layer 6 of photosensitive material. furthermore, means which are known per se may be used on the visor 1, for example to prevent parts of the visor from misting up or becoming moist. the helmet and the visor 1 are each provided with length - adjustable connecting means, which are known per se, for being fixedly or detachably connected together. apart from the above - explained sandwich variant and the variant in which the pigment or the pigments are incorporated in the plastic or the polycarbonate, the uv - sensitive or light - sensitive material 6 must be provided on the outer side of the visor 1, as it would otherwise take too long for the material to adapt its transparency in case of a change in the amount of light incident thereon, which might lead to unsafe situations. it is for that reason that the material is intentionally not provided on the inner side of the visor 1.",a visor having a curved transparent plate includes a photochromic material layer detachably mounted on the transparent plate . the photochromic material layer including a photochromic pigment is provided at the convex outer side of the transparent plate and a seal element is provided at a location to maintain a certain spacing between the transparent plate and the photochromic material layer and to prevent water ingress between the two surfaces . an anti - scratch coating is applied at an outer side of the photochromic material layer .
"the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. fig3 shows the steps of a method for irradiating an object with x - ray radiation and reconstructing an image of the object based on detected x - ray radiation, when the object is placed in the x - ray ct described in fig1. in step 310, x - ray radiation is generated by the x - ray source 3 of the x - ray ct and irradiated towards the array detector or plurality of detectors 5 shown in fig2. the detector or the a / d generates in step 320 a signal corresponding for example to the intensity of the x - ray radiation received by the detector. various combinations of detectors have been discussed regarding fig2. in step 330, the output of the detector elements 5 a, after being collected by the data collection unit 11, are digitized to form an x - ray profile of the detector or a / d data, in preparation of the next steps of the process to be applied. this digitized data is called pure data because it reflects pure measured data without any processing, and includes errors produced by the detector. in step 340, various processes generically called preprocessing are applied to the digitized data obtained in step 330. the preprocessing includes but is not limited to reference and offset correction, water calibration sensitivity disparity correction, etc. the preprocessing is applied to the digitized x - ray profile for removing some of the errors present. however, the preprocessing of step 340 does not remove the errors attributed to the overflow condition discussed above. other preprocesses are disclosed in u. s. pat. no. 5, 825, 842, which content is included in its entirety hereby by reference. the result of the preprocessing step 340 is used in step 350 for producing reconstruction data. the reconstruction data has a different profile than the digitized data. in step 360 the reconstruction of the irradiated object is determined based on the reconstruction data obtained in step 350. the reconstruction step 360 assembles together the data from all the channels of the detector 5 and step 370 produces the final, reconstructed, ct image of the object. in another embodiment, the data collection unit 11 and the processing unit 12 collect data from many rows of detectors, and the processing unit 12, based on all the data collected by the data collection unit 11, produces the final, reconstructed, ct image and displays that image on the display 13. however, due to the overflow condition discussed above, the reconstructed ct image has spurious features, which hide the real features of the subject. a diagram of the reconstruction processor 12 is shown in more detail in fig4. projection data from the collection unit 11 is stored in data memory 15, and image memory 14 is provided for storing the reconstructed image data or for storing the image data that is being reconstructed. memories 14 and 15 can be implemented as a ram or other semiconductor memory known by one skilled in the art of computer memories. an overflow correction unit 16 includes at least a polynomial unit, a spline unit, and a prior knowledge unit, and also may include a weighting unit. the functions of these units will be discussed with reference to fig5. units 14 16 and their operations are controlled by cpu 17. cpu 17 can determine the overflow points and carry out desired processing on the projection data obtained from the data collection unit 11, to correct the overflow condition. a more detailed diagram of another construction of the reconstruction processor 12 is shown in fig5. the image memory 14 and the data memory 15 are connected to the cpu 17. also connected to, and controlled by cpu 17, are a polynomial unit 18, a spline unit 19, a prior knowledge unit 20, a weighting unit 21, an overflow unit 22, a converting unit 23, a selection unit 24, an interpolation unit 25, a prior knowledge input unit 26, and a mapping unit 27. the polynomial and spline units 18 and 19, respectively, perform overflow corrections and the weighting unit 21 performs an overflow correction using a combination of an output from the polynomial unit 18 and an output from the spline unit 19. the processor 12 shown in fig4 and 5 could be implemented in hardware as a dedicated microcomputer, or could be implemented in software. for example the overflow correction unit 16 could be implemented as a semiconductor gate array. in a particular example that is not intended to limit the embodiments of the present invention, fig6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) show plots of measured x - ray intensity detected by the x - ray detector and reconstruction data reconstructed by the processor 12, respectively. more specifically, fig6 ( a ) shows the x - ray intensity measured by detectors and digitized by a / ds plotted versus the channels that measure the x - ray intensity. curve ( a ) shows the true x - ray intensity ( the real values of the x - ray intensity ) produced by the x - ray source 3, and curve ( b ) shows the pure a / d data or the measured and digitized data. as can be seen in fig6 ( a ), region ( i ) of the true x - ray intensity is different than the same region of the measured x - ray intensity because of the overflow condition. when the overflow is present, the real values of the x - ray intensity are replaced in the measured data with a value equal to the maximum input level s dmax, producing a flat profile. fig6 ( b ) shows the reconstruction data produced in step 360 discussed above. curve ( c ) corresponds to the true reconstruction data ( based on true x - ray intensity values ( a ) ), and shows a profile that is different than a profile of the overflow reconstruction data that corresponds to curve ( d ), which is reconstructed based on the measured data ( b ). fig6 ( a ) shows that the measured data ( b ) has a flat portion where the detector or a / d is not capable of measuring the real value of the x - ray intensity and that flat portion could be identified in a collection of data by the flat characteristic. however, the overflow reconstruction data ( d ) does not have the flat characteristic, which makes it difficult to identify overflow channels when analyzing the overflow reconstruction data ( d ). the overflow reconstruction data ( d ) has two characteristics that are discussed next. first, the overflow reconstruction data ( d ), which includes overflow points, is not clipped or constant in region ( i ), as the measured x - ray intensity ( b ), but has a profile that exhibits noise and may have discontinuities. this profile causes ring artifacts in the reconstructed images produced by the processing unit 12 and displayed on the display 13. second, the magnitude of the overflow reconstruction data ( d ) is higher than the magnitude of the true reconstruction data ( c ) ( data without overflow points ). the effect of this characteristic in the reconstructed images is a darkening and potential loss of physiological structure in the final ct image. fig7 illustrates a process of reconstruction of a ct image that identifies overflow points and corrects those points based on various algorithms. this process has some of the steps similar to the steps of fig3, and therefore those steps are not described here. in the current embodiment, the process shown in fig7 is implemented on a row - by - row basis in terms of the detector elements ( in other embodiments it can be implemented on a column basis, or on a temporal basis with a single detector ). further, in the current embodiment, the overflow correction step 770 takes place after the preprocessing step 740. the overflow correction step 770 is placed in this order because in some applications it is not feasible to implement the overflow correction before preprocessing due to hardware speed constraints or other constraints. in other embodiments, where speed is not a factor, the overflow correction step can be placed before the preprocessing step. as discussed above, when a level of the x - ray intensity measured by a detector is beyond the maximum signal range for which the detector is capable of detecting the x - ray intensity, the detector clips and a false value is output by the detector, as long as the overflow condition is maintained. to correct the false values introduced by the clipped detectors, the process of fig7 identifies the overflow points ( see for example those points in curve ( b ), region ( i ), of fig6 ( a ) ) and creates a map of the overflow points. because it is not possible to determine the overflowing points, when the overflow condition is present, directly from the reconstruction data obtained in step 760, the preprocessing step 740 creates the overflow map in step 750, based on the pure a / d data ( b ) shown in fig6 ( a ). the overflow map is a binary map indicating which channels of the x - ray detector are in the overflow condition. the overflow map is used in the next steps, when applying the overflow correction to the overflow points. in step 770, the overflow correction is applied to those values of the reconstruction data that correspond to channels that are in the overflow condition, as specified by the overflow map created in step 750. after the overflow correction step 770 corrects the reconstruction data of step 760, the reconstruction step 780 constructs the image of the object and displays in step 790 the reconstructed ct image of the object on the display 13. in this way, the method, system, and computer program product of the present invention correct the ring artifacts, the darkening, and the potential loss of physiological structure in the reconstructed image that plague the background art systems. the inventors of the present invention have found that the overflow correction step 770 could be implemented by a variety of mathematical algorithms. one possible way is described in the embodiment shown in fig8. fig8 shows a block diagram corresponding to the overflow correction step 770 of fig7. based on the overflow map 810, and the reconstruction data 820 obtained in step 760 of fig7, individual and small groups of overflow points are identified and corrected in step 830, for example based on a linear interpolation. step 830 produces a new reconstruction data set reconstruction _ data by correcting only the individual and small groups of overflow points. the larger groups of overflow points are not corrected in step 830. for a better understanding of step 830, fig9 shows a diagramatical view of the overflow map 810 and the reconstruction data 820. the overflow map, positioned in the lower part of fig9, shows each channel of the array detector 5 along the x - axis. an empty circle denotes an overflow point that was corrected by interpolation in step 830, the lower solid circles correspond to original non - overflow points, and the upper solid circles correspond to overflow points yet to be corrected. the values of the reconstruction data reconstruction _ data & # 39 ; are shown in the upper part of fig9. an empty triangle indicates an overflow point that has been corrected by linear interpolation based on the values of the non - overflow points bordering the overflow point, and a solid triangle indicates overflow points that will be corrected by another procedure than a linear interpolation. the dashed line indicates a non - overflow curve, which is unknown for overflow conditions. one target of the process described in fig8 is to bring the overflow points as close as possible to the non - overflow curve. according to step 830, the linear interpolation correction is applied to those overflow points that respect a condition that a number of consecutive overflow points is less than a predetermined minimum consecutive overflow points min _ consecutive _ overflow _ pts number. the min _ consecutive _ overflow _ pts number is determined depending on the accuracy desired. the smaller the number, the better the accuracy of the process. the min _ consecutive _ overflow _ pts number is two in the example shown in fig9. fig9 shows three regions in which the overflow points are corrected using the linear interpolation. after the linear interpolation is performed in step 830, the overflow map is updated to reflect the corrected overflow points and the updated map is input in step 840 to identify groups of overflow points that do not respect the condition for the min _ consecutive _ overflow _ pts number. also, the reconstruction data provided at step 820 is updated with the corrected overflow points and is provided to other steps. in step 840, the process identifies groups of overflow points in the updated reconstruction data reconstruction _ data & # 39 ;, based on a procedure that will be discussed next. fig1 shows multiple groups of overflow points that are present in a row of channels. considering a row of channels at a time, a total number of overflow groups in a respective row of channels is denoted ofg. an overflow group g of the multiple groups of overflow points is shown for example in fig1. the position of the overflow group g is defined by a start point ofgstart [ g ] and by an end point of the group denoted ofgend [ g ]. the number of overflow points in the group g is ofgpts [ g ], and is given by the expression : a series of consecutive overflow points is considered a subgroup of a group if a number of non - overflow points mingroupspacing separating the consecutive overflow points is smaller or equal to a predetermined value. for example, in fig1, mingroupspacing is set to one and two subgroups ( a ) and ( b ) are part of the same group g because the number of non - overflow points between the two subgroups is one, which is less than mingroupspacing. thus, for a predetermined mingroupspacing, if a plurality of subgroups have between adjacent subgroups a number of non - overflow points less or equal to the mingroupspacing, the plurality of subgroups are considered one single group. however, in another embodiment of the present invention, the subgroups shown in fig1 could correspond to different groups. by selecting the groups and subgroups in a certain way, a better curve - fit could be achieved. further, fig1 shows that a non - overflow point could be part of an overflow group ( here one non - overflow point is part of the overflow group g ). after the ofg, ofgstart [ g ], ofgend [ g ], and ofgpts [ g ] are determined in step 840, various corrections are applied to the identified overflow groups. in step 850, a polynomial correction is applied to the overflow groups identified and defined in step 840. in the present embodiment, the overflow data is smoothened by fitting a polynomial of order n p as shown in fig1. however, in another embodiment of the present invention a different type of curve or low - pass filter is used to smooth the overflow data. fig1 shows that polynomials are fitted to the group g found in the reconstruction _ data & # 39 ; [ n ] for those points ( channels ) that obey the expression : where pfbpts is the number of non - overflow points bounding the overflow group g on each side of the group g. the pfbpts number is selected depending on various factors that will be discussed later. the polynomial correction is of the form : polyfit g [ ch ] = a = 0 n p - 1 c g [ a ] ch a ( 3 ) where c g [ a ] is the ath polynomial coefficient for the fit of group g. a general least - squares fit of the data in the overflow group to the polynomial equation ( 3 ) is used to obtain the polynomial coefficients c g [ a ], i. e, c g [ a ] = least squares fit of { ( ofgstart [ g ], reconstruction _ value [ ofgstart [ g ] ),. . . , ( ofgend [ g ], reconstruction _ value [ ofgend [ g ] ] ) } ( 4 ) a correction polysmooth using the polynomial defined by equation ( 3 ), is given by : the polysmooth correction does not interpolate or estimate the correct values of the overflow points in the reconstruction _ data & # 39 ;, but only smoothens out overflow regions, which removes ring - type artifacts in the reconstructed images. fig1 shows a solid line indicating the result of the polysmooth correction based on ( i ) the non - overflow points bordering the overflow group g, and ( ii ) the overflow points of the overflow group g. the solid line is not identical to the dash line that indicates the true reconstruction data discussed in fig9. step 850 could include a plurality of substeps and fig8 shows for example two substeps 851 and 852. substep 851 determines a third order polynomial fit for the overflow points in the overflow group g and step 852 interpolates the overflow points and substitutes them with a polynomial curve produced in substep 851 to better approximate the values of the real data. the process described in fig8 is not limited to applying a polynomial fit 850 after the overflow groups have been identified in step 840. for example, fig8 shows that the overflow correction process can go from step 840 to either step 860 in which a spline fit is applied to the overflow groups or to step 870 in which a combination of correction methods are applied. step 860 is similar to step 850 with a difference that another mathematical correction is applied. step 860 could include a plurality of steps or two steps as shown in fig8. in the example shown in fig8, which is not intended to limit the present embodiment of the invention to only two steps, a step 861 determines a spline curve that is fitted to non - overflow points and an output of step 861 is inputted to a step 862 in which a spline interpolation is applied to the non - overflow points bordering the overflow groups. in one embodiment of the present invention, the spline curve is fit to non - overflow points bordering each side of the group g of the reconstruction _ data & # 39 ;. the spline curve is given by : splinecurve g [ ch ] = splinefit ( reconstruction _ data [ m ] ) ( 6 ) where ofgstart [ g ] - sfpts m & lt ; ofgstart [ g ] and ( 7 ) ofgend [ g ] & lt ; m ofgend [ g ] + sfpts the spline fit is applied in this example to a total of 2 sfpts points that are found in the intervals defined by equation ( 7 ), the spline fit is applied until all the overflow points are corrected, and sfpts represents a number of non - overflow points bordering the overflow group g. in the current system, it was not possible for an overflow group to be located at the edge of the detector. in the general case, groups located at the edge of the detector will be extrapolated. the splinecurve g [ ch ] curve corresponding to channels ch is shown in fig1 as a solid line, which is different than the dash line that corresponds to the real value of the reconstruction data. the updated overflow map is used for correcting all the overflow points in the overflow group g. in fig1, the empty circle indicates the non - overflow points used to spline fit the splinecurve g [ ch ] curve, and the solid pentagons represent the corrected overflow points using the splinecurve g [ ch ] curve. after the spline fit has been applied to the overflow points of the group g, the overflow map is updated and the process is repeated for the remaining overflow groups until all the overflow groups are corrected. the process shown in fig8 is not limited only to polysmooth or splinefix corrections, but other mathematical correction algorithms could be used to correct the overflow points of the overflow groups. in general, the true reconstruction data is unknown when the overflow condition is present, and thus it is very difficult to generate a perfect correction. the splinefix generates a general correction of the overflow data, and sometimes, the magnitude of the splinefix correction will overcorrect or undercorrect the a / d data, which will introduce new artifacts into the final reconstructed images. the inventors of the present invention have found that a combination of polysmooth and splinefix produces an improved correction. in one embodiment of the present invention, an adaptive weighted average of the two corrections ( polysmooth and splinefix ) is implemented in step 870 in fig8. step 870 receives an output from the polysmooth correction step 850 and an output from the splinefix correction step 860. based on these two outputs, a new correction splinepolyfix is calculated as will be described further. however, in other embodiments of the present invention, a non - adaptive weighted or other functions, such as a weighted multiplication of the two, may be used to combine the two corrections or any other corrections. regarding the present embodiment, a magnitude of the spline curve correction is a function of slopes s l and s u of the non - overflow data, where s l is the slope of the non - overflow points on the lower side of the group ( smaller channel values ; left side of the overflow group in figures ) and s u is the slope on the upper side of the group ( larger channel values ; right side of overflow group in figures ). the polysmooth and splinefix corrections are combined using an adaptive weight w p determined by the maximum slope of the two slopes s l and s u. in another embodiment, w p is a function of a variety of overflow parameters, such as both slopes s l and s u, the number of points ofgpts in the overflow group g, or combinations of parameters. in this embodiment, the combination of the polysmooth and splinefix is splinepoly and is given by : splinepoly [ p ] = w p ( s m ) polysmooth [ p ] + splinefix [ p ] w p ( s m ) + 1 ( 9 ) where s m is the maximum slope of the slopes s l and s u : in the current embodiment, s l and s u are calculated by : s l = reconstruction _ data [ p l2 ] - reconstruction _ data [ p l1 ] p l2 - p l1 ( 11 ) and s u = reconstruction _ data [ p r2 ] - reconstruction _ data [ p r1 ] p r2 - p r1 ( 12 ) p l1 = ofg start [ g ] sfbpts ( 13 ) p l2 = ofg start [ g ] 1 ( 14 ) p r1 = ofg end t [ g ] + 1 ( 15 ) and p r2 = ofg end [ g ] + sfbpts. ( 16 ) as can be seen in equations ( 11 ) ( 16 ), the slopes s l and s u are calculated for non - overflow points bordering an overflow group. in the current embodiment, w p ( s m ) is determined by simulation as follows. non - overflow data ( pure data ) is either generated by simulation or acquired experimentally, and then this pure data is processed to produce non - overflow reconstruction _ data. the non - overflow pure data is then modified by simulation to produce overflow data, to account for the overflow condition. this overflow data is processed to produce overflow reconstruction _ data. because both the non - overflow and overflow reconstruction _ data are known, true values of w p as a function of s m are calculated. for example, different s m are calculated from a set of modified non - overflow pure data and corresponding w p values are determined by simulation by fitting overflow reconstruction data to the non - overflow reconstruction data. in the current embodiment, the two sets of s m and w p calculated by simulation are plotted together on a graph and a least - squares linear curve is fit for the w p versus s m data to produce the adaptive weighting function according to equation : where m and b are the slope and intercept, respectively, determined by the least - squares fit. in other embodiments, a different fitting function or a lookup table can be used for determining w p ( s m ). the splinepolyfix correction produces a correction having the characteristics of a spline curve scaled to statistically match the non - overflow data. this correction will produce an improved reconstructed image with fewer and reduced overflow artifacts. further improvements of the process described in fig8 could be achieved by using prior knowledge data regarding how the preprocessing step 740 in fig7 influences the non - overflow data. in the general case, prior knowledge data can be calibration data, a mathematical function, or a combination of both. in the case of the x - ray ct, for example, the preprocessing step could include water calibration, which introduces a distinct curved shape frequently having a vertex in the reconstruction data, as shown for example in fig6 ( b ) in the true reconstruction data ( c ). the position of the bottom vertex and the slope of the curve on both sides of the vertex is a function of the water calibration data used in the preprocessing step and of the position of the overflow group in the row of channels. the water calibration data is constant and is known prior to determining any correction. the splinepolyfix correction determined in step 870 can be combined with a prior knowledge data ( such as some general knowledge about the attenuation of object being scanned, such as head or abdomen ) obtained in step 880 to produce a better correction apfix : where apfix is the overflow correction with the prior knowledge, and f { } is a function that combines the splinepoly and the prior knowledge data ; such as a weight that scales splinepoly based on the prior knowledge. the splinepolyfix and apfix corrections estimate true data values of the overflow points. under certain conditions ( such as noise ), it is possible for the apfix and / or splinepolyfix to produce corrected values that are worse than the overflow data for a particular overflow group. this produces new undesirable artifacts in corrected images. thus, in step 890, a selection of the best correction among the corrections already discussed is determined. the splinepolyfix and apfix corrections are compared with the polysmooth correction to determine whether the corrections are valid. the validity of the corrections are determined if any splinepolyfix or apfix corrected point within an overflow group is greater than the corresponding polysmooth corrected point. if the above discussed condition is valid, then the correction is considered invalid. the flags for apfixvalid and splinepoly valid are set according to the following algorithm : the best correction for the overflow group g is determined according to table 1 : however, other embodiments can use different criteria for determining the validity of a correction and a selection of the best correction is then implemented. finally, in step 895 all the overflow points of the reconstruction data are corrected based on the results of table 1 and the input from the selection step 890, and the reconstructed image of the object is displayed on the display. any embodiment of the present invention conveniently may be implemented using a conventional general purpose computer or microdisc processor program according to the teachings of the present invention, as would be apparent to those skilled in the computer art. appropriate software may already be prepared by programmers of ordinary skill based on the teachings of the present disclosure, as would be apparent to those skilled in the software art. fig1 is a schematic illustration of a general purpose computer 1300 which can be programmed according to the teachings of the present invention. in fig1, the computer 1300 can be used to implement the processes of the present invention, wherein the computer includes, for example, a display device 1302 ( e. g., a touch screen monitor with a touch -

"as shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the present invention is concerned with a technique for nulling interference or jamming signals received with data signals at an antenna array. fig1 shows a portion of a global positioning system ( gps ) that receives a number of modulated rf signals from an antenna array 11 and detects one or more binary codes originally transmitted from a corresponding number of orbiting satellites. the detected codes are supplied to a gps navigation processor ( not shown ), which processes the codes to determine the precise location of the receiver. the modulated signals received from the antenna array 11 can sometimes contain interference in the form of a jamming signal. null processing and beam steering apparatus 13, embodying the present invention, and a conventional tracking and detection circuit 15, process the modulated signals and substantially eliminate the effects of the interference. as shown in fig1 the antenna array 11 includes n elements, designated 17a - 17n. the modulated antenna signals are supplied on lines 19a - 19n to the null processing and beam steering apparatus 13, which produces quadrature i and q data signals on lines 21 and 23, respectively, for input to the tracking and detection circuit 15. the latter circuit generates reference signals i ref and q ref on lines 24 and 25 for use in demodulation in the apparatus 13, and also generates a replica of the pseudorandom number ( pn code ) on line 26 for use in the apparatus 13. as is well known, when phase lock closure is achieved by the tracking and detection circuit 15, no satellite signal component is present in the q channel output of apparatus 13. the circuit 15, which is of conventional design, extracts certain information from the i and q data signals, and supplies this information to the gps navigation processor, as indicated by data path 27. the apparatus 13 receives clock signals over line 28 from a reference oscillator 29, which also supplies clock signals to the tracking and detection circuit 15, on line 30. the prior grobert patent ( u. s. pat. no. 4, 734, 701 ) discloses a simplified technique for null processing, without the need for complex weighting adjustment of the received antenna signals prior to summation. basically, this technique effects weighting after demodulation and conversion of the signals to digital form. although the technique results in nulling of any jamming signals, it may also result in the generation of one or spurious nulls in the antenna pattern, which adversely affect operation of the receiver if a spurious null is directionally aligned with an information signal source, such as a gps satellite. in accordance with the present invention, nulling of a jamming signal is effected in a manner similar to that of the prior grobert patent, but the effects of spurious nulls are practically eliminated by providing for steering of the antenna beam to move a spurious null away from a signal source of interest. basically, the object of the invention is achieved by combining two circuits : the nulling circuit of the prior grobert patent and an antenna beam steering circuit. although antenna beam steering using an array of antenna elements is a relatively simple matter in the absence of jamming signals, it is not immediately obvious how one might effect antenna beam steering in the presence of jamming, and concurrently with operation of the nulling circuit. to facilitate an explanation of the invention, the nulling and beam steering functions will be described separately, using separate block diagrams ; then the combined functions will be described using a single block diagram. throughout this description, it will be understood that numerous references to & # 34 ; circuits, & # 34 ; & # 34 ; mixers, & # 34 ; & # 34 ; integrators, & # 34 ; & # 34 ; summers, & # 34 ; & # 34 ; filters & # 34 ; and the like should not be taken to mean that there are separate hardware components for performing these functions. as in the earlier grobert patent, the preferred mode of implementation is software, using a programmed microprocessor or similar component for performing the various functions on digital forms of the input signals. as in the prior patent, the elemental functions being performed by the software are relatively simple, and it will be readily understood by anyone of ordinary skill in the programming and signal processing arts how to implement the various functions in software form. for purposes of explanation, however, it is expedient to describe each component as if it were a discrete piece of hardware. fig2 a and 2b together show how a jamming signal is nulled in accordance with the invention, and further depicts how ac ( alternating current ) coupling is used to avoid nulling the information signals as well as the jamming signal. for convenience of illustration, only two antennas and associated processing apparatus are shown : a primary antenna element, referred to with the suffix & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; and an auxiliary antenna element, referred to with the suffix & # 34 ; 2 & # 34 ;. thus the quadrature signals derived from the primary antenna element 17a are referred to as i 1 and q 1, and the corresponding signals derived from auxiliary antenna element 17b are referred to as i 2 and q 2. where identical or similar components are used in processing the primary and auxiliary signals, they are referred to by the same reference numeral, but using suffixes & # 34 ; a & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; b, & # 34 ; respectively. the first step in processing the received rf signals is performed in demodulators 32a and 32b. it will be understood that the demodulation step encompasses everything performed in the & # 34 ; hardware & # 34 ; section of the circuit disclosed in the prior grobert patent, including downconverting, removing pn code from the modulate rf signals, and mixing the signals with reference i and q signals fed back from the tracking and detection circuit 15 ( fig1 ). for purposes of this specification, the & # 34 ; demodulation & # 34 ; step performed in blocks 32a and 32b also includes low - pass filtering the signals to include only an approximately 1 - khz bandwidth, and converting the analog signals to digital form. thus the i 1 and q 1 signals output from the demodulator 32a are filtered digital baseband signals, as are the i 2 and q 2 signals output from the demodulator 32b. the circuit of fig2 a produces a nulled i output signal on line 34 from the input signals i 1, i 2 and q 2. basically the nulled i output signal is obtained by summing, in summer 36, the i 1 signal and a weighted contribution derived from the i 2 and q 2 input signals. the nulled i output signal on line 34 is fed back over line 37 and correlated with the i 2 and q 2 signals to produce the weighted auxiliary contribution. an i 2 weighting circuit comprises a mixer 38, a negative integrator 40 and a multiplier 42. the mixer 38 produces an output product signal for input to the negative integrator 40, the output of which is in turn fed to the multiplier 42. also input to the multiplier 42 is the i 2 signal. the output of the multiplier 42 is connected to one input of another summer 44. the other input to summer 44 is derived from another weighting circuit, comprising a mixer 46, a negative integrator 48 and a multiplier 50. this circuit correlates the 35 nulled i output signal with the q 2 input signal and produces the required input to summer 44. the output of summer 44 is connected as a second input to summer 36, which generates the nulled i output. operation of the nulling circuit of fig2 a can be best understood by considering the relative phases of signals at various points in the circuit. although a jamming signal will in general be felt as a broadband noise - like signal, it is helpful for purposes of analysis to consider a single sinusoidal component of the jamming signal. for example, if the jamming signal reaches the antenna 17b first, and the antenna 17a is spaced one half - wavelength from antenna 17b, the signals i 1 and i 2 can be represented as oppositely directed vectors, as indicated at the demodulator outputs. for q 2 the signal is represented by a vector that leads the i 2 vector by 90. initially, the outputs of the multipliers 42 and 50 will be zero and the i 1 signal will appear on the nulled i output line 34. when this signal is fed back and correlated with the i 2 input, in mixer 38, the mixer will produce a negative output and the associated negative integrator 40 will begin to ramp to a positive value. thus multiplier 42 will begin to produce an output with the same phase as i 2, which will tend to cancel the i 1 signal in summer 36, as indicated by & # 34 ; / 0 & # 34 ;. adjacent to line 34. at the same time the i 1 - phased signal on line 34 will not correlate with the q 2 signal, since the two signals are orthogonal, and integrator 48 will stay at its zero level. after a time, negative integrator 40 will reach a level at which the contribution from i 2 will completely cancel the i 1 signal in summer 36, and the jammer component on output line 34 will be zero, i. e. completely nulled out. at this point there will be no correlation, in mixer 38, between the signal on line 34 and the i 2 input signal, so the negative integrator 40 will remain at its current cumulative level and the nulling operation will be complete. a similar analysis may be made assuming a different phasing of the received jamming signals. for example, if it is assumed that the jamming signal source is exactly overhead and reaches the two antenna elements in phase, then i 1 and i 2 will be in phase, if it is further assumed that the electrical paths followed by these signals do not inject any phase differences. initially, the correlation of the signal on line 34 and the i 2 input signal will be positive, and the negative integrator 40 will begin to ramp negatively. thus the multiplier 42 will invert the i 2 signal, and the resulting signal will tend to cancel the i 1 signal when the two are added in summer 36. further, the analysis is not affected by the presence of additional auxiliary antennas and circuits. for each additional auxiliary circuit n, the output signal on line 34 is correlated with the i n and q n components, and the resulting contribution is input to the same summer 36. nulling of the q output signal is performed in a similar fashion, as indicated in fig2 b. the q 1 input is summed in summer 60 with contributions derived from the auxiliary inputs. more specifically, the q nulling circuit includes an i 2 weightign cirucit comprising a mixer 62, a negative integrator 64 and a multiplier 66, and a q 2 weighting circuit comprising a mixer 68, a negative integrator 70 and a multiplier 72. a nulled q output signal on line 74 is fed back and correlated with the i 2 and q 2 input signals in the mixers 62 and 68, the result being accumulated in the negative integrators 64 and 70, and applied as a weighting factor in the multipliers 66 and 72. the resulting weighted values if i 2 and q 2 are combined in a summer 76, and then input to the summer 60 to be combined with the q 1 input signal. the circuit of fig2 b generates the nulled q signal on line 74 in much the same way that the nulled i signal is generated. following the same example as fig2 a, initially the q 1 input signal will be impressed on the output line 74, and fed back for correlation with the i 2 and q 2 input signals. initially, the i 2 and q 1 signals will not correlate, being orthogonal. the negative integrator 64 will remain at zero and there will be no weighted contribution from the i 2 component. in mixer 68, the q 2 signal correlates with the q 1 signal, since one is the inverse of the other, and the negative integrator 70 begins to ramp positively. thus a q 2 component is input to the summer 76 and then to the summer 60, tending to cancel the q 1 input and producing the desired nulled q signal, as indicated by & # 34 ; / 0 & # 34 ; adjacent to line 74. when the nulled q output is zero, negative integrator 70 continues to hold a positive value and continues to provide the necessary weighting factor to produce a nulling effect. as described thus far, the circuit of fig2 a and 2b will function to null any signals received by the antenna elements 17, including signals from the gps satellites. the presently preferred embodiment of the invention uses ac coupling to permit the satellite signals to pass through the circuit without being subject to nulling. the circuit of fig2 a includes three coupling capacitors for this purpose. one capacitor 80 is connected in line 37, which feeds back the nulled i output for correlation with the i 2 and q 2 inputs. second and third capacitors 82 and 84 are connected in the i 2 and q 2 input lines to the mixers 38 and 46, respectively. the jamming signal is composed of relatively high frequencies and couples easily through these capacitors. because the data signals received from the satellite are basically dc ( direct current ) or of very low frequency, the capacitors present a very high impedance to these signals. therefore, the i and q data signals pass directly through the the summers 36 and 60 and onto the output lines 34 and 74, respectively, without unwanted compensation by the nulling circuitry. the dynamic weighting principles used in the nulling circuitry of fig2 a and 2b can also be used to steer the antenna beam, as will now be explained with reference to fig3 a and 3b. fig3 a includes many of the same components as fig2 a. for ease in comparing the two figures, primed and identical versions of the same reference numerals have been used where appropriate. thus the fig3 a circuit includes summer 36 to which i 1 is input, and summer 44 for combining the outputs of two weighting circuits that determine the weights of the i 2 and q 2 input signals. the principal difference, as contrasted with fig2 a, is that fig3 a does not include any capacitors for ac coupling. as described thus far, the circuit will perform nulling of an input data signal, and will therefore produce a zero output from the summer 36. another important addition to the circuit is an additional summer 90 and an inverter 92. the inverter 92 inverts the i 1 input signal and connects it to the summer 90. the other input of the summer 90 is taken from the auxiliary input to summer 36. in effect, then, summer 90 has the same inputs as summer 36, but subtracts one input from the other instead of adding them. therefore, instead of nulling the i 1 signal the summer 90 produces an enhanced signal on output line 94, referred to as a beamed i output signal. formation of a beamed q signal makes use of an observable property of the nulling circuitry. when the circuitry is operating on a jamming signal and forms a null in the i output, there is an almost exact relationship between the weighting values in the circuits for processing the i and q signals. specifically, the i 2 weighting factor in the circuit for producing the nulled i output is the same as the q 2 weighting factor in the circuit for producing the nulled q output. further, the q 2 weighting factor in the circuit for producing the nulled i output is the inverse of the i 2 weighting factor in the circuit for producing the nulled q output. in symbolic form, if the factors for i 2 weighting and q 2 weighting in the nulled i circuit are i 2i and q 2i, respectively, and the factors for i 2 weighting and q 2 weighting in the nulled q circuit are i 2q and q 2q, respectively, then : for brevity, the foregoing relationship will be referred to in this specification as cross - strapping with a change of sign. fig3 b shows how a beamed q output signal is generated using the cross - strapping relationship. the circuit consists of summer 76, multipliers 66 & # 39 ; and 72 & # 39 ;, an additional summer 94, and inverters 96 and 98. using the cross - strapping principle, multiplier 66 & # 39 ; receives as an input the inverted form of the signal produced by negative integrator 48 & # 39 ; ( fig3 a ), supplied through connector b and inverter 98. similarly, multiplier 72 & # 39 ; receives an input from negative inverter 48 & # 39 ;, through connector b and without inversion. the multipliers 66 & # 39 ; and 72 & # 39 ; also have as inputs the demodulated i 2 and q 2 signals, respectively, and produce outputs connected to summer 76, which combines the correctly weighted i 2 and q 2 contributions. the output of summer 76 is coupled as an input to the additional summer 94, which also receives as an input the inverted form of the q 1 input signal, through inverter 96. summer 94 and inverter 96 generate the difference between the q 1 input signal and the auxiliary components that are sufficient to null q 1. therefore, the output of summer 94 is a beamed q signal. forming a beamed q signal int his manner is required because there is no satellite signal q component present when the receiver phase lock loop is closed. for the same reasons that the nulling circuit of fig2 a and 2b produces an antenna pattern null that will automatically track the directional position of a jamming signal, the beam steering circuit of fig3 a and 3b will automatically track the directional position of a moving satellite signal source. however, the circuit of fig3 a and 3b will not operate properly in the presence of a jamming signal, since, if the jamming signal dominates, the antenna array will be effectively beamed toward the jamming signal instead of toward the desired signal source. a further modification is needed to permit beam steering in the presence of a jamming signal. because of the nature of spread spectrum modulation techniques used in the gps and other communication systems, a jamming signal may be spread over a wide range of frequencies and has the appearance of broadband noise. some of the jamming signal noise is removed by the low - pass filters included in the demodulation process already described. however, when an effective jamming signal is present the signal output from the low - pass filters ( which have a bandwidth of approximately 1 khz ) will typically have a negative signal to noise ratio ( snr ), which means that the noise has a greater power than the signal. the further improvement depicted in fig4 requires the addition of additional low - pass filters 100, 102 and 104 having a bandwidth of only approximately 1 hz. filter 100 is connected in the i 1 input line to summer 36 & # 39 ;, and filters 102 and 104 are connected in the i 2 and q 2 input lines to mixers 38 & # 39 ; and 46 & # 39 ;, respectively. these filters remove practically all of the noise generated by the jamming signal, but permit the satellite information signals to pass. because of the action of tracking loops in the tracking and detection circuitry 15 ( fig1 ), the satellite signals are basically dc signals that will be passed by the very narrow bandwidth low - pass filters 100, 102 and 104. one additional step is needed to ensure that the satellite signals will pass through the filters. gps signals are encoded with data at a low data rate of approximately 50 bits per second. as low as this data rate is, it still will not pass through the 1 hz filters, so must be removed from the satellite signals to permit beam steering to operate. the step of removing the data is performed in mixers 106, 108, 110 and 112, the first three of which are connected in series with and immediately prior to the filters 100, 102 and 104, respectively. the fourth mixer 112 is connected between the output of summer 44 and the lower input of summer 36 & # 39 ;. each of these mixers has as its other input a signal referred as dsign, which is indicative of the sign of the data signal. the data being removed in the mixers is encoded on the baseband signals as a succession of sign reversals at the 50 hz data rate. as will shortly be described, the sign of the i data signal can be conveniently derived and fed back as the dsign signal. thus the effect of the mixers 106, 108, 110 and 112 is to remove the sign reversals in the input data signal, so that the signal will pass through the low - pass filters and beam steering will be operative. another difference between fig4 and fig3 a is that the final summer 36 & # 39 ; in fig4 has its i 1 input inverted, as indicated by a minus sign. initially, the input to summer 36 & # 39 ; derived from the weighting circuits will be zero, and the i 1 signal will appear in inverted form at the output of summer 36 & # 39 ;. in mixer 38 & # 39 ; this inverted i 1 signal will be correlated negatively with the input i 2 signal having the opposite phase, and the negative integrator 40 & # 39 ; will begin to ramp up positively. thus multiplier 42 & # 39 ; will leave the sign of the input i 2 signal unchanged, as indicated by the right - directed vector at the lower input of summer 36 & # 39 ;. therefore, the output of the summer 36 & # 39 ; will converge on a zero value. it will be appreciated that the inverter 92 and summer 90 of fig3 a have been omitted from fig4 for simplicity, and that a corresponding circuit for forming a beamed q signal in the presence of jamming has not been shown. however, a complete beam steering and nulling circuit will be discussed with reference to fig5 a and 5b. up to this point, the nulling and beam steering functions have been described separately, although fig4 depicts beam steering in the presence of a jamming signal. on first consideration, it may appear to be impossible to implement both nulling and beam steering functions simultaneously since there is no q signal component present due to the action of the receiver phase lock loop. the nulling operation is performed by automatically adjusting weighting circuits to form an antenna pattern in which a null is aligned with a jamming signal source. the beam steering operation has as its goal the adjustment of the antenna pattern to be aligned with a desired signal source, and thereby to enhance the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) performance of the receiver. it would seem to be impossible to perform both functions at the same time. although the circuits shown in fig2 - 4 have included only two antenna elements ( one primary element and one auxiliary element ), it was noted earlier that a practical embodiment of the invention would include more antenna elements than two, and a corresponding number of processing circuits. in general, for an n - element antenna array, a system could be designed to null as many as n - 1 jamming signals. a unique combination of the weight settings in the nulling circuit must be determined to null all n - 1 jammers, and the system is then said to be fully constrained. if the number of jamming signals is n - 2 or less, the system is said to be less than fully constrained and there is an infinite number of weight setting combinations that may selected to implement nulling of all the jamming signals. so long as the nulling system is less than fully constrained, beam steering is possible in addition to jammer nulling. a combined beam steering and jammer nulling circuit is shown in fig5 a and 5b. fig5 a is basically a combination of the features shown in fig2 a and 4. the ac - coupled nulling circuit includes the summer 36, which combines the i 1 input signal with the output of summer 44, which in turn combines weighted i 2 and q 2 inputs. nulling is accomplished by feeding back the i output signal on line 34 to the mixers 38 and 46, which also receives input signals i 2 and q 2. the outputs from these two mixers are connected to separate negative integrators 40 & # 39 ; and 48 & # 39 ;, the outputs of which are connected to respective multipliers 42 & # 39 ; and 50 & # 39 ;. these multipliers apply appropriate weighting to the i 2 and q 2 input signals, which are then combined in summer 44. the nulling function is performed exactly as described with reference to fig2 a. nulling of the satellite information signals is precluded by the presence of capacitors 80, 82 and 84. summer 44 has additional inputs from similar weighting circuits used to weight the signal contributions derived from third, fourth and additional antenna elements. the weighting circuits for determining these additional contributions has been omitted for clarity. the beam steering circuitry of fig5 a includes the mixer 106 for removing data from the i 1 input signal, the low - pass filter 100, and the summer 36 & # 39 ;. the two inputs to the summer 36 & # 39 ; are an inverted i 1 input, derived from the mixer 106 and the filter 100, and the auxiliary input derived from the summer 44, through the additional mixer 112 used to remove data modulation. the output of mixer 36 & # 39 ; is fed back to mixers 38 & # 39 ; and 46 & # 39 ; for correlation with the i 2 and q 2 input signals. negative integrator 40 & # 39 ; receives input from two sources : mixer 38, which correlates a nulling error signal from summer 36 with the i 2 input signal, and mixer 38 & # 39 ;, which correlates a beam steering error signal from summer 36 & # 39 ; with the i 2 input signal. likewise, negative integrator 48 & # 39 ; receives inputs from mixer 46 and mixer 46 & # 39 ;. the negative integrators develop weighting factors that are influenced by both the nulling function and the beam steering function of the circuit. the relative weight given to each function is controlled by a beam steering loop gain amplifier 120, having a gain factor g s. in the presently preferred embodiment of the invention the value of g s is less than unity. a value of approximately 1 / 128 has proved satisfactory for most situations, but other gain factors may used to achieve desired performance characteristics. in any event, it appears that a relatively weak beam steering loop is all that is needed to & # 34 ; nudge & # 34 ; the weighting factors enough to move any spurious nulls away from the direction of a data signal. the circuit for generating a q output signal combining jammer nulling and beam steering principles when there is no q signal component present int he q channel output is shown in fig5 b. it includes the features of the nulling circuit of fig2 b, specifically the summer 60 for combining the q 1 input signal and a combined weighting signal generated by summer 76. the nulled q output signal is fed back, through ac coupling, to mixers 62 and 68, which correlate the nulled signal with i 2 and q 2 inputs. negative integrators 64 and 70 accumulated the outputs of the respective mixers 62 and 68, and generated weighting factors for applications to multipliers 66 and 72, respectively. i 2 and q 2 input signals weighted by the multiplier outputs are combined in the summer 76, which also receives weighted input components from other similar weighting circuits that process signals from additional antenna elements. adjustment of the q weighting factors is effected in part by cross - strapping with sign reversal from the i weighting factors of fig5 a, and in part by a control loop associated with each q weighting circuit. in particular, the weighting circuit associated with the i 2 input further includes a multiplier 122 and loop gain amplifier 124. the multiplier 122 derives one input from the negative integrator 64 and the other, through connector b, from negative integrator 48 & # 39 ; ( fig5 a ). the output of the multiplier is amplified by the gain amplifier 124 and then fed back into negative integrator 64 as a second input. a similar loop circuit is provided for nudging the q 2 weighting factor, including a multiplier 126 and a loop gain amplifier 128. following the cross strapping principle, this multiplier obtains one input, negated, from negative integrator 40 & # 39 ;, through connector a, and obtains its other input from negative integrator 70. the multiplier output is amplified by loop gain amplifier 128 and fed back into the negative integrator 70 as a second input. the loop gain factor g q provided by the amplifiers 122 and 128 is again preferably less than unity. a value of approximately 1 / 4 is presently favored, to provide a relatively weak beam steering influence on the q weighting factors. as described earlier, the beam steering function of the invention depends principally on the use of a very low - pass filter ( 100, 102 and 104 in fig5 a ). if, as in the case of gps, there is a low - frequency data modulation on the received signal, this must be removed for beam steering purposes, to permit the information signal to pass through the filters. in the case of gps, the data signal takes the form of a sign modulation at 50 bits per second. the signal dsign is used to remove this modulation in mixers 106, 108, 110 and 112. the dsign signal is easy to derive from the i output signal on line 34, and requires only a summing circuit 130 and a limiter 132. the summing circuit integrates the incoming signal over 20 - millisecond intervals, under control of a conventionally derived data - rate clocking signal ( not shown ), and the limiter produces a positive or negative output signal indicative of the sign of the information signal. this is the dsign signal used to strip data from the information signal for purposes of beam steering. performance of the apparatus of the invention is obviously very much dependent on the degree to which the system is constrained by the presence of jamming signals. so long as the system is not completely constrained, i. e. with fewer than n - 1 jammers present, the beam steering loop will operate to & # 34 ; nudge & # 34 ; the weighting factors sufficiently to move any spurious nulls away from the direction of incoming signals. this avoids the cycle - slipping problem alluded to earlier, and at the same time provides a substantial improvement in snr performance. once the system becomes constrained by the presence of n - 1 jammers, its operation reverts to that of a pure jammer nulling circuit, and spurious nulls may affect the receiver performance. it will be appreciated from the foregoing that the present invention represents a significant advance in the field of signal processing receivers subject to interference from jamming signals. in particular, the invention provides a technique for nulling out a limited number of jamming signals while at the same time steering the antenna array to avoid the alignment of a spurious null in the antenna pattern with the direction of a signal of interest. it will also be appreciated that, although an embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.","a system for processing modulated signals received , together with at least one interference signal , by an array of antenna elements in a communications receiver . the method of the invention includes demodulating the received signals , and processing the demodulated signals to produce an output signal that is substantially free of any interference signals , while at the same time effectively steering the antenna pattern produced by the array of elements , to move any spurious nulls in the pattern away from a source of information signals . this results in avoidance of any cycle slipping problems that might otherwise arise in receiver tracking control loops , and has the added benefit of significantly improving performance as measured by the signal - to - noise ratio ."
"the following description outlines how the mounting device of the present invention may be used in association with a drum. the mounting device may however be used to attach an accessory to other musical instruments. referring to fig1 the accessory mounting device of the present invention, shown generally at 2, is adapted to engage a drum lug 4 mounted on the side 6 of a drum 8. mounting device 2 includes a base 10 which may be manufactured from metal, plastic, wood or any other suitable material. base 10 defines an inner surface 16 and an outer surface 20. first and second legs 12, 14 extend from opposite ends of base 10. first and second legs may be formed as an integral part of base 10 or may be mounted on base 10 by a suitable means. alternatively, one of the first and second legs 12, 14 may be formed as an integral part of base 10, while the other of the first and second legs 12, 14 may be mounted on base 10. base 10 defines a channel 18 in outer surface 20 of base 10. channel 18 may be shaped, being essentially flat ( 19 ) proximate second leg 14 and convexly curved ( 21 ) proximate first leg 12. first and second feet 22, 24 extend from the ends of first and second legs 12, 14. feet 22, 24 may be manufactured from any resilient material such as rubber. first foot 22 may be glued onto the end of first leg 22 or may be received within a recess ( fig7 ) at the end of first leg 22. first foot 22 may also be attached with a suitable connector such as a screw, a nail etc. second leg 14 defines a longitudinal bore 26 through which a threaded or partially threaded shaft 28 is inserted. shaft 28 has stopper 30 at one end and second foot 24 at the other end. shaft 28 may be loosely received within longitudinal bore 26. stopper 30 prevents shaft 28 from being completely withdrawn from bore 26. second foot 24 is mounted on nut 32 so that foot 24 has a firm base. second foot 24 is preferably a resilient pad which is shaped so as to enable it to more fully engage curved side 6 of drum 8. a knurled adjuster nut 34 is disposed between nut 32 and inner end 36 of second leg 14. when adjuster nut 34 abuts inner end 36 of second leg 14, rotation of adjuster nut 34 causes second foot 24 to be moved toward or away from upper end 36. adjuster nut 34 engages threads 35 on shaft 28. shaft 28, nut 32 and adjuster nut 34 are preferably made from a suitable metal. base 10 further includes an accessory holder 37 for receiving and holding an accessory 90. base 10 defines an aperture 38 that receives a portion of holder 37. a shock pin 40 inserted in aperture 38. aperture 38 is disposed in an area of base 10 adjacent first leg 12. shock pin 40 includes a shaft 42 having a first end 44, a second end 46 and an area of greater diameter 48 proximate its middle. first end 44 of shaft 42 is externally threaded and second end 46 includes pin bore 50. shaft 42 is surrounded by a resilient shock absorber 52. pin 40 and absorber 52 are secured together at first end 46 of shaft 44 with a washer 54 and a connector 56 that prevents shaft 42 from moving upwardly with respect to connector 56. pin 40 and absorber 52 are frictionally held within aperture 38. a mount tube 82, being internally threaded on one end 84 and externally threaded on the other end 86, may be screwed onto end 44 of shock pin 40. an internally threaded jam nut 88 is used to secure accessory 90 ( such as a microphone ) onto tube 82. shock pin 40 and mount tube 82 are shown as two separate components, but may be formed as a single unit without departing from the scope of this invention. both shock pin 40 and mount tube 82 may be made from metal, plastic, wood or other suitable material. a slot 58 is provided in the inner surface 16 of base 10, intermediate first and second legs 12, 14. slot 58 opens into channel 18. a portion of latching member 60 for securing device 2 to drum lug 4 is received within slot 58. latching member 60 may be any suitable mechanism which engages and secures base 10 to lug 4. in the drawings, latching member 60 includes a shaft 62 that has a hole 64 proximate one end. hole 64 is normal to the longitudinal axis of shaft 62 and is adapted to receive a roll pin 66 therethrough. the other end of shaft 62 includes a hook 68 which extends between first and second legs 12, 14 when shaft 62 is received within slot 58. hook 68 may be configured with the curved end as shown in the drawings, or hook 68 may include a t - shaped end or a l - shaped end. latching member 60 includes a lever 70 which is at least partially disposed within channel 18. lever 70 may be substantially l shaped having a first longer arm 72 and a second shorter arm 74. lever 70 includes a hole 76 which is adapted to align with hole 64 of latching member 60. lever 70 is secured to latching member 60 by roll pin 66 being inserted through hole 64 and hole 76. latching member 60 is prevented from being withdrawn from slot 58 by lever 70 and hook 68. shaft 62 of latching member 60 is loosely held within slot 58 so that hook 68 may be manipulated to engage drum lug 4. shaft 62 may be moved within slot 58 so that hook 68 is moved away from or drawn closer to the inner surface 16. additionally, shaft 62 can be rotated within slot 58 so that hook 58 opens either toward first leg 12 or second leg 14. this allows the user to select in which direction they wish to capture drum lug 4. shorter arm 74 of lever 70 may engage the curved portion of channel 18 to lock lever 70 in the closed position as will be further described. while latching member 60 has been described above as including shaft 62, hook 68 lever 70, any other suitable lug engaging latching member 60 may be used. for example, a flexible cord ( not shown ) may be looped around lug 4, drawn through slot 58 and secured by a clamp ( not shown ) that creates enough tension in the cord to hold base 10 on drum 8. the clamp may be a nut and threaded rod combination that allows the user to vary the tensile force in the cord. in another embodiment, shaft 62 may have a threaded portion that receives a nut. rotation of the nut against body 10 would create a tensile force in shaft 62 to hold body 10 in place. various other tension - creating devices and arrangements may be used to hold body 10 onto drum 8. referring to fig7 to 10, the device of the present invention is used in the following manner. base 10 is brought into close proximity to side 6 of drum 8. first foot 22 is placed against side 6 and hook 68 is moved behind drum lug 4 by manipulating lever 70 ( fig7 ). the user then rotates adjuster nut 34 to move second foot 24 into contact with side 6 as shown in fig8. longer arm 72 of lever 70 is rotated toward second leg 14 in the manner shown in fig9. this draws hook 68 into contact with drum lug 4. the user continues to rotate longer arm 72 until it reaches the position shown in fig1 where lever 70 locks in a first position. continued rotation of longer arm 72 until edge 78 contacts outer surface 80 of second leg 14 is possible. this movement brings shorter arm 74 into contact with the curved surface of channel 18 and also draws hook 68 further down toward the inner surface 16 of base 10. when edge 78 contacts outer surface 80, lever 70 is locked in a second position. this second position may be required in certain situations where drum lug 4 is not securely gripped when latching member 60 is in the position shown in fig1. care must be taken not to grip drum lug 4 too tightly as this may cause damage to the drum 8. microphone 90 is then secured to mount tube 82 by screwing jam nut 88 into place to grip it. in the situation where shaft 62 is rotated so that hook 68 opens toward second leg 14, lever 70 is rotated in an opposite direction to that shown in fig7 through 10. lever 70 is rotated by the user & # 39 ; s finger ( not shown ). when hook 68 is fully engaged with drum lug 4 and is locked into position as shown in fig1, the opposing action of second foot 24 engaging side 6 by virtue of shaft 28 being held in place by adjuster nut 34, serves to urge base 10 into engagement with side 6 of drum 8. this securely holds the device in place against side 6 of the drum 8 and provides a firm and secure footing for an accessory. referring to fig7 through 10, when microphone 90 is to be detached from drum 8, jam nut 88 is loosened and microphone 90 is removed. if the user so desires, microphone 90 may be left attached to mount tube 82 and mount tube 82 is simply unscrewed from shock pin 40. the user then rotates lever 70 in an opposite direction to that shown in fig1 and 9. as lever 70 rotates, hook 68 disengages from drum lug 4. the user then moves second leg 14 off side 6 in such a manner that hook 68 clears drum lug 4. first leg 12 is then pulled away from side 6 and the device may be stored for future use. in the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding. no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. moreover, the description and illustration of the invention is an example and the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described.","the mounting device releasably mounts an accessory , such as a microphone , to a lug of a musical instrument such as a drum . the device includes a base , a lug - engaging connector mounted on the base and an accessory support mounted on the base . the accessory releasably attaches to the accessory support ."
"referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to fig3 thereof, a block diagram of a data processing system according to the present invention is illustrated. in fig3 a main memory 34 is coupled with a system bus ( s - bus ) 30. an input / output processor ( iop ) 33 and a central processing unit ( cpu ) are connected to the system bus 30. the central processing unit cpu 31 includes a high speed memory 51. the high speed memory 51 is used as a general register ( gr ) and as a scratchpad memory ( spm ). an arithmetic and a logic unit ( alu ) 54 is connected to the high speed memory 51 by way of the d - bus 59, the a - bus 58, and a register ( reg ) 55 and performs various arithmetic and logical operations. the register reg 55 is connected to the d - bus 59 and the arithmetic and logic unit 54 and temporarily stores the results before or after an operation of the arithmetic and logic unit 54. the a - bus 58 is connected to the system bus 30 by way of a driver 56. an instruction code from the main memory 34 is loaded into an instruction register ( ir ) 53 through the system bus 30, a receiver 57, and the a - bus 58. an address register ( ar ) 52 stores an address of the high speed memory 51. control memory ( cs ) 62 stores a microprogram. the microinstruction register ( ir ) 63 stores microinstructions from the ir 63. the microprogram sequencer ( seq ) 64 includes a microprogram address register ( ar ) 65, an adder ciruit ( + 1 ) 66, and an address selecter ( sel ) 67. the microprogram sequencer seq 64 forms a real address based on the microprogram stored in the cs 62. the cs 62 is connected to the adder 66 of the microprogram sequencer 64 which is connected to the instruction register ir 53 and to the microinstruction register ir 63, and selects one address in accordance with the microprogram control. a device similar to the microprogram sequencer seq 64 is described in a manual issued by advanced micro devices corporation, microprogram sequencer am 2911. the central processing unit 31 includes a dynamic address translator ( dat ) 36. the dynamic address translator 36 includes a memory which stores the page table. the details of the dynamic address translator 36 will be described with reference to fig4. in fig4 the lower 12 bits ( bits 0 - 11 ) of the virtual address correspond to the lower 12 bits of the real address. the upper 12 bits ( i. e. ), bits 12 - 23 shown in fig4 ) ; of the virtual address designate the memory address of the page table ( pt - ram ) 37. the output of the page table pt - ram 37 forms not only the upper bits ( bits 12 - 21 ) of the real address but also acts as an input to a driver 41. the output of the driver 41 is connected to the system bus 30 and controls a microprogram of the central processing unit 31 to enable the reading of the output of the page table pt - ram 37 under the control of an internal signal of the central processing unit 31. the microprogram of the central processing unit 31 can write a desired real address in the page table pt - ram 37 to which the a - bus 58 is connected. the page table pt - ram 37 may be formed from a random access memory of 4096 words. referring now to fig5 the format of a data word used in the page table pt - ram 37 in fig4 is illustrated. each word of the page table pt - ram 37 includes upper bits of the real address ( i. e., bits 20 - 31 shown in fig5 ) and control bits v, r and c. bit v is a validity bit to indicate that the upper bit of the real address included in the words should be effective. bit r is a reference bit to be set to & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; each time the word is accessed. bit c is a change bit to be set to & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; each time the word is accessed for writing. referring back to fig4 the operation of the dynamic address translater 36 will be explained when the central processing unit 31 accesses the memory by designating a virtual address. bits 12 - 23 of the virtual address given from central processing unit 31 address the page table pt - ram 37. the output of the page table pt - ram 37 becomes bits 12 - 21 of the real address. bits 0 - 11 of the real address use bits 0 - 11 of the virtual address. the real address obtained in the manner as explained above is transferred to the main memory 34 to address it through the d - bus 59 shown in fig3. in this embodiment, the input / output processor 33 also addresses the main memory 34 with the real address. the central processing unit translates the virtual address preliminarily into the real address by means of software when it gives a channel program to the input / output processor. it is apparent from fig4 that the dynamic address translator 36 is simplified. almost all of the dynamic address translator 36 is in page table pt - ram 37. the size of the page table pt - ram 37 is twice the capacity of the memories 22 and 25 as in the translation look - aside buffer 13 of the prior art using a memory element of 1k words. thus the dynamic address translator 36 can be constructed of a hardware equivalent of the translation look - aside buffer 13 of the prior art. dynamic address translator 12 of the prior art includes not only the translation look - aside buffer 13 but also an adder and a register for address calculation to access page table 15 in the main memory, an access control circuit for the main memory, and a sequential control circuit etc. as a result of locating the page table in the dynamic address translation and not in the main memory, it is unnecessary to prepare the above mentioned circuits and it is only necessary to utilize one half of the hardware. in the near feature, when a high speed static random access memory having a large capacity of 4k words times 4 bits is available, it will further enlarge the merits of the present invention because one memory 22 in the translation look - aside buffer in fig2 is similar in size to the page table pr - ram 37 in fig4. now referring to fig6 a pth instruction i. e., an instruction to modify the page table 37, will be explained as follows. the format of the pth instruction and the usage of it by a general register are shown in fig6. the pth instruction provides the means by which the operating system defines and revises the page table 37 within the dynamic address translator 36. when it is necessary to utilize the central processing unit, it is convenient to address it via software using the page table if the necessary hardware is available to write such contents as to translate the same real address to the virtual address within the real address of the page table pt - ram 37. the pth instruction includes a portion serving as an instruction code ( op ), another portion to indicate the general register, and a portion ( c ) for variation of itself. with respect to the pth instruction, a general register grn stores the virtual address and the general register stores the upper 16 bits of a word of the page table. in the present embodiment of the present invention, the virtual address is stored in the general register. it is possible to design an instruction format to designate a virtual address by a portion of the instruction word. this variation of the pth instruction by the c bit is as follows. in the following explanation each word in the page table is referred to as a page table entry ( pte ). write the upper 16 bits of the general register grn + 1 into the page table entry pte designated by the virtual address in the general register grn. each entry of the page table pt is formed by 13 bits of information. in the present embodiment the 31st bit, the 30th bit, and the 16th bit are extended bits, i. e., bits which are not actually entered or stored in the page table. set the page table entry designated by the virtual address in the general register grn to the upper 16 bits of the general register grn + 1. reset the r bit of the page table entry designated by the virtual address in the general register grn to zero. fig7 is a flow chart of an embodiment of the page table entry instruction. the operation of the central processing unit thus constructed will now be described referring to fig7. the central processing unit 31 reads the software instruction using the main memory 34. the instruction read is set into the instruction register 53 through the a - bus 58 from the system bus 30. the instruction code op set in the instruction register 53 is decoded by ) seq 64. when the contents of the instruction code op is the pth instruction, the control is removed to the ) seq 64, where the microprogram routine for implementing the pth instruction is performed. in other words, the variation of the pth instruction is judged by the c bit. the head address for processing the microprogram corresponds to the variation in the control bit c is determined. when the control bit is ( c -

"it is to be understood and appreciated that the process steps and structures described below do not cover a complete process flow. the present invention can be practiced in conjunction with various integrated circuit fabrication techniques that are used in the art, and only so much of the commonly practiced process steps are included herein as are necessary to provide an understanding of the present invention. the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. it should be noted that the drawings are in greatly simplified form and they are not drawn to scale. moreover, dimensions have been exaggerated in order to provide a clear illustration and understanding of the present invention. referring to fig1 a substrate 100 having a photoresist layer 102 thereon is shown. the substrate 100 can be a semiconductor substrate, such as a silicon wafer, but it is not necessary a semiconductor substrate. the substrate 100 can also comprises either a dielectric layer or a conductive layer thereon. in fact, the substrate 100 depends on the need of analysis. the photoresist layer 102 can be any photoresist material used in modern semiconductor industry. moreover, the photoresist layer 102 can be formed over the substrate 100 via conventional methods in the art, for example, a spin coating method. referring to fig2 a, in order to find the profile of a developed photoresist layer in the formation of a contact hole or a via hole, a hole pattern is transferred into the photoresist layer 102 to expose the substrate 100 by a conventional photolithography process. after developing the photoresist layer 102, the hole is formed. more particularly, owing to the standing wave effect, the sidewall of the hole has a profile shown in fig2 b. the profile can only be found via a tem analysis having a resolution about 1. 4 angstrom to about 1. 8 angstrom because the dimensions of the caves of the profile is tiny if the width of the hole shown in fig2 b is less than about 0. 2 micron. it is apparent that the profile is crucial if one need measuring the width of the hole precisely. referring to fig3 a conductive layer 104 is formed over the photoresist layer 102 and the bottom of the hole shown in fig2 a and a dielectric layer 106 is sequentially formed thereon. the conductive layer 104 can be a platinum layer, a gold layer, a copper layer, an aluminum layer and a titanium layer, and it is preferably a platinum layer. platinum is chose because it is a kind of stable or noble metal and it can be formed with a very thin thickness. the conductive layer 104 is preferably formed via a physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) process, for example, a dc sputtering process performing at about 20 c. to about 30 c. the temperature of the pvd process is necessarily low because a high temperature environment would render the photoresist material shrinking or shape change. in fact, not only the formation temperature of the conductive layer cannot be over a certain temperature at which the photoresist layer starts to shrink or change its shape, but also the temperature of the entire tem photoresist sample preparation process cannot exceed the certain temperature. the thickness of the conductive layer 104 is between about 50 to about 200 angstroms, and is preferably about 100 angstroms. as shown in fig3 the conductive layer 104 fails to fill the hole due to the tiny dimension of the hole and the limited step coverage ability of the pvd process. however, this profile is not crucial for this invention. the conductive layer 104 is used to isolate the photoresist layer 102 from moisture environment and prevent the photoresist layer 102 from oxidation. furthermore, the conductive layer 104 can also avoid the charging effect resulting from the use of electron or ion beams. moreover, the conductive layer 104 is very helpful to clarify the interface between the photoresist layer 102 and the dielectric layer 106. the dielectric layer 106 can be either a silicon dioxide layer or a silicon nitride layer, and is preferably a silicon dioxide layer. the dielectric layer 106 is formed via a physical vapor deposition process, and preferably a dc sputtering process. the sputtering process is performed via an ion miller used in the conventional tem sample preparation. by accelerating argon ion ( ar + ) plasma, silicon dioxide or silicon nitride molecules are sputtered from a quartz glass target or a silicon nitride target. the sputtering process is performed at a pressure of about 10 6 torr. this sputtering process is also performed at about 20 c. to about 30 c. the thickness of the dielectric layer 106 is between about 500 angstroms to about 1 micron, and is preferably 1000 angstroms. the dielectric layer 106 is used to protect the photoresist layer 102 from being damage amid the sample slicing process by a focused ion beam ( fib ) technique used gallium ions ( ga + ). it is found that the damage thickness of a common focused ion beam slicing is about 500 angstroms. the thickness of the protective dielectric layer must exceed 500 angstroms. after forming the dielectric layer 102, the substrate 100 such as a silicon wafer is sliced by using a fib to form tem samples 200 having dimensions of about 10 micron about 5 micron about 0. 2 micron as shown in fig4 wherein the length is about 10 micron, the width is about 5 micron and the thickness is about 0. 2 micron. in order to observe the tem sample prepared by the method of the invention, the tem sample 200 is then placed on a copper net having a carbon film coated thereon via an electrostatic pick up method used a glass needle having a tiny tip of about 1 micron. the method of the tem sample preparation set forth is used to prepare a photoresist sample having via or contact holes therein. however, this method can also be used to prepare a photoresist sample having other structure. for example, as shown in fig5 the photoresist layer 102 is used to define a gate electrode and the substrate 100 can be a conductive layer such as a polysilicon layer. in every embodiment of this invention, the conductive layer 104 and the dielectric layer 106 can protect the photoresist layer 102 and isolate the photoresist layer 102 from a moisture and oxygen - contained environment. moreover, the contraction of the photoresist layer 102 amid the bombardments by electron beams of a tem or a fib will be avoided effectively. the conductive layer 104 is mainly used to release the charges resulting from the electron beams of a tem or a fib. because the sample 200 observed is placed on a carbon film on a copper net, the conductive layer 104 may be omitted. other embodiments of the invention will appear to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. it is intended that the specification and examples to be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.","a method of sample preparation for transmission electron microscope analysis is disclosed . the method renders a typical tem analysis on a sample having a photoresist layer practical . the method uses a conductive layer and a dielectric layer to protect a photoresist layer of the tem sample from slicing damages and ion bombardments . the conductive layer and the dielectric layer can also isolate the photoresist layer from moisture and oxygen - contained environments and prevent the photoresist layer from

"coloring of a graph is a term used to describe any number of processes for assigning weights to nodes in the graph by allocating a quantity ( or multiple quantities ) to a node and having some of that quantity or quantities propagate to other nodes connected to the allocated node. the name might derive from the idea that pouring a quantity of colored paint on one node would cause the node and its neighbors to be colored to varying degrees. in the examples here, coloring results in nodes being assigned values indicative of their weight for certain operations. in the example of searching a corpus of documents linked as in a graph where each document is a node in the graph, coloring might be used to weight pages for the purposes of ranking search results. for example, users might present queries to a querying system that performs a search of a corpus for documents or other items that are deemed to satisfy the search ( i. e., search hits ) and a weight associated a hit might be indicative of how interested in the particular user is expected to be in that hit. coloring methods can be used to paint indications of interest on a graph representing a web of documents. when the weights are aggregated, each hit that is so evaluated would have an associated authority value ( or weight ) representative of the authority the user might associate with a page represented by the hit. an analog to determining authority weights to nodes of a graph is in determining relative importance of airports for a particular traveler or travelers in the aggregate. consider a graph of air traffic for world travel, which airports as nodes linked by edges representing flights. such a graph would be similar to a directed graph, w, representing a hyperlinked web of documents such as the world wide web. weights for how important an airport is to an individual traveler orchard travelers in the aggregate might be measured by an amount of the money passing through that airport. as an example of a simulation, assume each traveler spends fraction of his or her money currently available in each airport, having less and less money as the trip progresses. assume the traveler begins travel at node b corresponding to houston, tex. obviously, many passengers go to atlanta, chicago and new york. due to vacation destinations and business affiliations, some traffic lands in hawaii, dsseldorf, and oil producing countries. however, very few people confidently go from houston to ukraine, ceylon, or tibet. from a business standpoint, such rare destinations do not matter. they do matter, however, for traffic originating in moscow, bombay, or beijing. to find how much money is spent on average at different nodes, authority values can be determined through a process performed assuming a random walk ( and teleportation to houston ) until o & # 39 ; hara or jfk magnitudes sufficiently converge. unfortunately, these two important nodes are treated equally by the typical analysis process relative to any landing field in ukraine, ceylon or tibet. however, with a coloring approach such as one described herein, spending funds flow with the traffic, possibly having a cutoff threshold as a stopping criterion. this allows for not propagating beyond more or less significant destinations. thus, the solution is sparse, and in either case, the result is computed much more efficiently. in addition, before a less significant node, such as the dsseldorf node, is processed, two important airport nodes of munich and frankfurt in germany would be most probably touched. both direct some traffic to dsseldorf and so handling of a propagation from here can be delayed to reflect both munich and frankfurt components. this accounts for additional savings in computation efforts, and allows for super positioning of results, such as pre - computed values and custom values. additional computation can be saved through the use of the hub concept. munich and frankfurt are hubs in germany and heathrow is a hub in the uk. in thinking about traffic from houston, it would be very useful to know in advance traffic distributions corresponding to hubs, since these are the airports where most people do their connections. thus, instead of gradual propagation from each reached node, known hub distributions can be reused when a hub is reached. such modulo hubs computation is described herein as h - relative bc processing. further gains in computational efficiency can be had by simplifying the process of referencing all hub distributions, r. to this end, a simplification can be done wherein most traffic is recognized as going between the hubs, with a relatively small remainder spilling over more or less locally. thus, a hub skeleton can be created that allows hub calculations to determine hub distributions represented by a very sparse spillover and within the hub distribution. fig1 illustrates a general overview of an information retrieval and communication network 10 including a client system 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention. in computer network 10, client system 20 is coupled through the internet 40, or other communication network, e. g., over any local area network ( lan ) or wide area network ( wan ) connection, to any number of server systems 50 1 to 50 n. as will be described herein, client system 20 is configured according to the present invention to communicate with any of server systems 50 1 to 50 n, e. g., to access, receive, retrieve and display media content and other information such as web pages. several elements in the system shown in fig1 include conventional, well - known elements that need not be explained in detail here. for example, client system 20 could include a desktop personal computer, workstation, laptop, personal digital assistant ( pda ), cell phone, or any wap - enabled device or any other computing device capable of interfacing directly or indirectly to the internet. client system 20 typically runs a browsing program, such as microsoft & # 39 ; s internet explorer browser, netscape navigator browser, mozilla browser, opera browser, or a wap - enabled browser in the case of a cell phone, pda or other wireless device, or the like, allowing a user of client system 20 to access, process and view information and pages available to it from server systems 50 1 to 50 n over internet 40. client system 20 also typically includes one or more user interface devices 22, such as a keyboard, a mouse, touch screen, pen or the like, for interacting with a graphical user interface ( gui ) provided by the browser on a display ( e. g., monitor screen, lcd display, etc. ), in conjunction with pages, forms and other information provided by server systems 50 1 to 50 n or other servers. the present invention is suitable for use with the internet, which refers to a specific global internetwork of networks. however, it should be understood that other networks can be used instead of or in addition to the internet, such as an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network ( vpn ), a non - tcp / ip based network, any lan or wan or the like. according to one embodiment, client system 20 and all of its components are operator configurable using an application including computer code run using a central processing unit such as an intel pentium processor, amd athlon processor, or the like or multiple processors. computer code for operating and configuring client system 20 to communicate, process and display data and media content as described herein is preferably downloaded and stored on a hard disk, but the entire program code, or portions thereof, may also be stored in any other volatile or non - volatile memory medium or device as is well known, such as a rom or ram, or provided on any media capable of storing program code, such as a compact disk ( cd ) medium, a digital versatile disk ( dvd ) medium, a floppy disk, and the like. additionally, the entire program code, or portions thereof, may be transmitted and downloaded from a software source, e. g., from one of server systems 50 1 to 50 n to client system 20 over the internet, or transmitted over any other network connection ( e. g., extranet, vpn, lan, or other conventional networks ) using any communication medium and protocols ( e. g., tcp / ip, http, https, ethernet, or other conventional media and protocols ). it should be appreciated that computer code for implementing aspects of the present invention can be c, c + +, html, xml, java, javascript, etc. code, or any other suitable scripting language ( e. g., vbscript ), or any other suitable programming language that can be executed on client system 20 or compiled to execute on client system 20. in some embodiments, no code is downloaded to client system 20, and needed code is executed by a server, or code already present at client system 20 is executed. fig2 illustrates another information retrieval and communication network 110 for communicating media content according to an embodiment of the invention. as shown, network 110 includes client system 120, one or more content server systems 150, and a search server system 160. in network 110, client system 120 is communicably coupled through internet 140 or other communication network to server systems 150 and 160. as discussed above, client system 120 and its components are configured to communicate with server systems 150 and 160 and other server systems over the internet 140 or other communication networks. according to one embodiment, a client application ( represented as module 125 ) executing on client system 120 includes instructions for controlling client system 120 and its components to communicate with server systems 150 and 160 and to process and display data content received therefrom. client application 125 is preferably transmitted and downloaded to client system 120 from a software source such as a remote server system ( e. g., server systems 150, server system 160 or other remote server system ), although client application module 125 can be provided on any software storage medium such as a floppy disk, cd, dvd, etc., as discussed above. for example, in one aspect, client application module 125 may be provided over the internet 140 to client system 120 in an html wrapper including various controls such as, for example, embedded javascript or active x controls, for manipulating data and rendering data in various objects, frames and windows. additionally, client application module 125 includes various software modules for processing data and media content, such as a specialized search module 126 for processing search requests and search result data, a user interface module 127 for rendering data and media content in text and data frames and active windows, e. g., browser windows and dialog boxes, and an application interface module 128 for interfacing and communicating with various applications executing on client 120. examples of various applications executing on client system 120 for which application interface module 128 is preferably configured to interface with according to aspects of the present invention include various e - mail applications, instant messaging ( im ) applications, browser applications, document management applications and others. further, interface module 127 may include a browser, such as a default browser configured on client system 120 or a different browser. according to one embodiment, search server system 160 is configured to provide search result data and media content to client system 120, and content server system 150 is configured to provide data and media content such as web pages to client system 120, for example, in response to links selected in search result pages provided by search server system 160. in some variations, search server system 160 returns content as well as, or instead of, links and / or other references to content. search server system 160 is also preferably configured to record user query activity in the form of query log files described below. search server system 160 in one embodiment references various page indexes 170 that are populated with, e. g., pages, links to pages, data representing the content of indexed pages, etc. page indexes may be generated by various collection technologies including automatic web crawlers, spiders, etc., as well as manual or semi - automatic classification algorithms and interfaces for classifying and ranking web pages within a hierarchical structure. these technologies may be implemented on search server system 160 or in a separate system ( not shown ) that generates a page index 170 and makes it available to search server system 160. an entry 162 in page index 170 includes a search term, a link ( or other encoded identifier ) to a page in which that term appears and a context identifier for the page. the context identifier may be used for grouping similar results for search terms that may have different meanings in different contexts. for example, the search term java may refer to the java computer language, to the indonesian island of java, or to coffee ( which is often colloquially referred to as java ). the context identifier for a page advantageously indicates which of these contexts is applicable. a page link may be associated with multiple context identifiers, so the same page ( or a link thereto ) may be displayed in multiple contexts. context identifiers are preferably automatically associated with page links by the system as users perform related searches ; however, the identifiers may also be modified and associated with links manually by a team of one or more index editors. in this manner, knowledge gleaned from numerous searches can be fed back into the system to define and re - define contexts to make the displayed search results more valuable and useful to the requesting user. search server system 160 is configured to provide data responsive to various search requests received from a client system, in particular from search module 126. for example, search server system 160 may be configured with search related algorithms for processing and ranking web pages relative to a given query ( e. g., based on a combination of logical relevance, as measured by patterns of occurrence of the search terms in the query ; context identifiers ; page sponsorship ; etc. ). as shown in fig2, search server system 160 provides its output ( results, suggestions, media content, etc. ) to a bcv processor 180 that returns the output with weighting information such as authority values for each item in the output. fig3 illustrates one embodiment of bcv processor 180 in greater detail. as shown there, results or other output are received by the results weighter 300. results weighter 300 can use information contained in any generic preference database 302, a user preference database 304, precalculated hub weight data 306, additional weighting rules from rule base 308 and possibly other sources. using those inputs and according to weighting instructions 320, results weighter 320 outputs the results or other search server system outputs to a sorter 330 along with weightings for the output. sorter 330 can then reorder such output according to their weights and that can be provided ( by a system as shown in fig2 ) to a client having requested a search. a number of a different sets of weighting instructions will now be described. it should be understood that combinations of these different sets and / or variations thereof could be used instead of exactly what is described herein and a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand how to modify these teachings to cover additional variations. the weights can be used to order search hits, determine where to crawl for more material, or otherwise influence the search process. in general, connectivity among items in a search corpus can be used in a coloring model. in the examples herein, the search corpus is a collection of hyperlinked documents and connectivity is indicated by links between documents. however it should be understood that these teachings might be used with other variations. with a coloring model model, a coloring substance is diffused across the graph. a certain fraction,, of substance incoming to a current vertex stays with the vertex, while the rest flows to other vertices along out links. intensity of the color can be used to represent a vertex & # 39 ; s authority for ranking or other purpose. the process can be initiated with a fixed vertex that is a bookmark, thus the term bookmark coloring. such a process might determine a set of authority values referred to as a bookmark coloring vector ( bcv ) for the graph and particular inputs. a bcv is often an efficient and sparse data structure that leads to ordering of search results similar to page rank analysis, but with much less computation and storage. bcv processing can also be used for personalization based on a subset of hub page - specific precomputed bcvs. the bookmark - coloring model section below describes an introduced model and ways to compute bc values. the h - relative bookmark - coloring section below describes a more efficient way of finding general bc values when a set of hub page - specific bcvs are precomputed. the efficient computing of hub basis bcvs section below describes some ways of simultaneous computing and encoding the set of hub page - specific bcvs. the loop factor section below describes other useful improvements in the process dealing with loops in the graphs. the application to personalization section below describes how bcvs might be applied to personalization of web searches. in this section, bookmark - coloring models are described along with generalizations, bcv computing and comparison to conventional page ranking analysis. in a bookmark - coloring model, the process can be represented with expressions as follows. it should be understood that in a practical embodiment, processing would require some computing apparatus such as a general purpose computer programmed to perform the analysis. one input to a bookmark - coloring process ( bcp ) is a graph representing a set of hyperlinked pages, a social network, or other network structure generally having nodes and edges. with the graph, graph vertices represent the nodes of the network. in the case of web pages, edges are directed as out links from a linking page to a linked page. a bcp determine authority weights for some or all vertices of the graph. an authority weight for a node calculated using a bcp is referred to herein as a bookmark - coloring ( bc ) value and the bc values for a set of nodes / pages can be represented by a bookmark - coloring vector ( bcv ). a given graph can have more than one possible bcv, as the bc process can have different inputs for the same graph. under certain limited conditions, the authority weights of a bcv calculated using a bcp might coincide, or be proportional to, the authority weights of a page rank vector ( prv ) calculated using a page ranking process, but the use of bcp can be expected to provide better results and / or results with less computational effort. inputs to a bcp might include a graph, a set of nodes for initial color loading ( which are bookmarks in many examples herein ), viscosity parameters ( indicating how much color sticks and how much is passed on ), propagation thresholds, and other parameters. outputs of a bcp include a bcv. bcvs can be further processed, such as by being compressed or superimposed with other bcvs. starting with some node b, a fraction of a coloring substance that gets to node b is retained and a fraction ( 1 ) is distributed uniformly along the out links from node b. let p ( b ) represent a bookmark - coloring vector ( bcv ) corresponding to a starting node b ( with unit starting amount ) and a viscosity of ( i. e., 2 retention coefficient ). mathematically, the model is as shown in equation 10. p ( b ) = ( b ) + ( 1 - ) j p ( j ) / deg ( b ), where b - & gt ; j l. ( equ. 10 ) conceptually, the bookmark - coloring process suggested by ( equation 10 ) can be implemented by a program according to fig4, with w = 1 : p = bcp ( b, ) and bcp ( b, ) = bc ( b, 1, ). the recursion over all links from b to j can be cut off when the color amount becomes so small that its further distribution is infeasible or not likely to significantly affect the results. as a result of truncation of recursion, considerable computing effort can be saved, although some color amount is lost when color amount to be propagated from a node fells below threshold, or when a dangling page ( i. e., a page with no out links ) is encountered. however, such loss does not typically affect ranking and, unlike in the iterative computing of page ranking analysis, no renormalization is needed. one observation that might need to be dealt with is that the process of fig4 may require a very deep stack because of the recursion. to deal with that, a variation might be used. an additional advantage of this variation is that it deals with cases where different nodes engage the same node at different places in the travel of the process. since a node handles color amount from multiple sources uniformly, a good strategy is to wait until several color amounts reach a node and then process them. for this, a queue of requested transactions is provided with each transaction corresponding to a pair of a node j and a color amount w still to be distributed from this node along its out links. a data structure q is a queue preferably with direct access. elements of q are pairs ( j, w ). direct access refers to arrangements allowing for quick location of a pair by its key j, such as, for example, through the use of an index. fig5 illustrates a process corresponding to the variation of a bcp using a queue. further variations of the above - described analysis processes might work as well or better. for example, an approach coupling a fifo heuristic ( such as to perform a pop operation on a queue ) with a largest w goes first strategy might work well. to implement this variation, reshuffling of a queue might be done in a manner similar, but not limited, to sorting. by selecting the largest ( or at least large enough ) w to process, more balanced queues are built and most of the coloring substance being propagated is removed sooner rather than later, which speeds up convergence. while the above bc processes are shown dealing with single page - specific initial impacts, variations might use several bookmarks b with different initial amounts to initiate the same or similar outcomes. these can be accomplished by changing the initialization of the queue q in fig5 with a few pairs, one per bookmark. to personalize the search for a particular user, several bookmarks and associated weights ( both specific to a user ) might be used to construct a single bcv and that can be done through selection of the initial set b. this observation reflects linearity of the model. another possible generalization relates to a bookmark - coloring model itself. while uniform propagation along all out links is cheap, assigning to links some weights reflecting their quality is desirable ( e. g., anchor text related relevance ). this allows for different out links to be weighted differently based on their different characteristics. in page rank analyses, practical implementation of nonuniform weighting is very computationally expensive. in some cases, a more expensive treatment of links can be done for a small number of large w, while the remaining majority of small w can be handled using uniform treatment. in some variations, site internal links and site external links can be handled in a distinct manner ( such as by using different weights ) to avoid manipulation of a bc ranking. as an example, a site operator seeking to enhance the bc values for its pages might modify the out links of each page such that they point to pages within the site and those point to pages within the site, and so on to ensure that when color applied to a page within the site propagates, it propagates only to other pages of that site. with this variation, site internal links are underweighted or skipped over so that coloring is fairly distributed. for many sets of search results, the hits of the search results might have the same or similar authority values whether a page ranking process is used or a bookmark - coloring process is used, even though the processes start with different random surfer and bookmark - coloring models, and result from two distinct computational processes. to explain, let y i be the total color amount that passes through a node i. according to a bc model, an fraction p i = y i is retained by a node, the rest being distributed. value y i comprises two components : ( 1 ) the original unit impulse ( b ) of color, and ( 2 ) an amount that reaches node j in the result of propagation. thus, the value can be expressed as shown in equation 11. multiplying by a results in equation 12, which in vector form as is shown in equation 13. y j = j ( b ) + ( 1 - ) i - & gt ; j l y i / deg ( i ) ( equ. 11 ) p j = j ( b ) + ( 1 - ) i - & gt ; j l p i / deg ( i ) ( equ. 12 ) note that equation 13 corresponds with equation 9 for a page ranking vector for a page - specific teleportation v = ( b ) and c = ( 1 ). mathematically speaking, the outcomes might be similar, at least in absence of dangling pages and under assumption that all computations are performed to infinite precision, but in practice the bookmark - coloring process can be done with much less computation. in other words, a bcp with a page - specific teleportation vector of v = ( b ) serving as a initial impulse is a much more focused analysis than page ranking analysis, which equally treats all the nodes and spends most of the time on irrelevant nodes. in comparison, a bcp uses local propagation and therefore is connectivity sensitive. some experiments show that existent pair updates happen approximately five times more frequently than adding a new pair. this delayed handling results in a significant saving having no analog in iterative page ranking analysis. for this and other reasons, computing of a bookmark - coloring vector is significantly faster than comparable computing of a page - specific page ranking vector. bcv approximation has another interesting property : it is sparse. after several iterations ( equal to a modest w graph diameter ), a page - specific page ranking vector for a page b might become non - zero on any page reachable from page b. a bookmark - coloring vector tends to preserve its sparsity as affected pages are grouped around the initial page b and bcp activity grows the vicinity of b adaptively propagation does not penetrate beyond the threshold - imposed barrier when one is present. while the use of a barrier may mean that a vector is only appropriate for ordering part of a result set, relatively low magnitudes of whatever authority vector are less reliable in an ordering process and in real applications an authority vector is only one of many components used by the ranking process. sparsity is very beneficial for maintenance and personalization, since encoded sparse objects can be accessed faster. assume that a subset of important pages h w in w ( having, for example, high uniform authorities ) called a hub is selected, and that n = | h | different basis r ( h ) = bcp ( h, ) vectors for h h are computed. this set of known basis r ( h ) vectors can be leveraged for computing, for a page b, a vector p ( b ) = bcp ( b, ) when b h. with such leverage, an application could personalize using any bookmark inside h or outside h and avoid a need of using other technologies to provide coefficients for hub pages. while basis hub bcvs are pre - computed, usage of a bookmark outside h requires online computing of corresponding bcv. a way to do this efficiently is described below. this superimposition is useful. a topic - sensitive search approach can use, for example, information retrieval correlations to construct coefficients for a couple of hundreds of topic - specific prvs. when a bookmark is outside the hub set h, an efficient way shown below can be used to find a projection of its bcv p on hub basis bcvs, effectively approximating p by a linear combination of basis bcvs. a projection of a bcv p on basis vectors might be constructed as illustrated in equation 14. p = s 1 r ( 1 ) +. . . + s n r ( n ) + v ( equ. 14 ) in that equation, p is a linear combination of bcvs for n pages in h ( a projection ) corrected by v. coefficients s and correction v are determined from p. if their computing is easier than computing the original p, precomputed basis vectors r ( h ) can be said to have been successfully leveraged. while super position is normally expected to be linear, other combination nodes might also be available such that precomputation reduces the amount of processing needed. with this in mind, a modification of a bcp called h - relative bookmark - coloring processing ( h - relative bcp ) will now be described. h - bcp regards h as a blocking subset. if a color propagation process hits a page outside h, h - relative bcp treats it as described above. if, on the other hand, color reaches h h, its amount w h is fully retained by h with no further propagation. the result of so blocked propagation can be split into two terms. the first one, v, is the result over non - hub pages w \ h extended to h by zeroes. that is referred to as h - relative bcv, v | h = 0. the second one, s = { s h, h h }, is the color blocked by h. h - relative bcp is a sort of modulo h ( or mod h ) computing process, with a conditional probability notation such as, ( given hub h. or | h ), bcp ( b, ) mod h = bcp ( b, | h ). referring to fig6, bcp ( b, | h ) = bc ( b, 1, | h ), where [ v, s ] = bc ( b, w, | h ). fig6 illustrates a process for h - relative bcp. because of blocking, vector v is sparser than p : if any path from b to j crosses h, then v j is zero, while p j is not. moreover, a larger h results in a sparser v. as a result, this process is very scalable. the blocked version is also significantly faster : in real q - implementation, queue q is not filled whenever a blocking page h is encountered. any bcv can be obtained from its h - relative version and a set of precomputed bookmark specific vectors r ( h ) as is shown here. assume that [ v, s ] = bcp ( b, | h ). then p = bcp ( b, ) is equal to p i as shown in equation 15. p i = v i + h h r i ( h ) s h ( equ. 15 ) therefore, precomputed r ( h ) can be used to get p from fast and sparse h - relative bcp results. both v and s are linear in p. this is because each h h knows how to distribute its color this is what the r ( h ) are for. therefore, all that is needed to know is how much color gets to each h in h ( this is s ) and where color that has not hit h on its way landed ( this is v ). equation 15 can be expressed in a vector form shown in equation 16 where matrix r has columns that are hub h - specific bcvs with dim ( r ) = n n and where v is zero on h and is sparser than p, dim ( v ) = n, and dim ( s ) = n. p = v + r s, r = ( r i ( h ), i = 0 : n 1, h h ( equ. 16 ) in practice, terms with s h below certain threshold can be skipped. potentially h - relative vectors can be computed at query time with low accuracy, but that should be sufficient in many applications. the previous section describes how knowledge of basis bcvs r ( h ) vectors for h h can be used for effectively computing p ( b ) for b h. equation 16 assumes that matrix r, whose columns are full basis bcvs, is available. another reason to have r is just to use linear combinations of its columns with some coefficients that are supplied by additional informational sources ( e. g., finding topical coefficients ). effective computing and maintenance of matrix r presents challenges, such as computing many basis bcvs r ( h ), is computationally difficult and fetching basis vectors r ( h ) in memory generates huge i / o costs. some improvements can help. computation of a set of n basis vectors r ( h ) can be shortened and simultaneously compressed. this compressed form can be encoded and accessed during i / o stages. in exchange for effective computing and encoding, one matrix multiplication by a n n matrix is added to the effort. let r = ( r i ( h ) ), i = 0 : n 1, h h denote a matrix of basis bcvs r ( h ). it has dimensions n n, n = | w |, n = | h |. before this, the system assumed that b h. if b h, h - relative bcp stops right away with v = 0, s = ( b ). this is a trivial result saying that to compute r ( h ) it must be known to the system. consider a simple generalization of h - relative propagation model : at the first propagation step from b = h retain a of the initial w = 1 assigning it to h component of r ( h ) and distribute the rest 1 over out links. from this moment on, revert to regular h - relative bcp : w propagates over nodes outside h or get blocked by nodes within h. considering this, equation 17 can be used in place of equation 15. r i ( b ) = i ( b ) v i ( b ) + h h r i ( h ) s h ( b ) ( equ. 17 ) in this formula, the term describes a very first step impact, v is a relative partial vector equal to zero over h, and s are blocked weights. here, b and h vary over the h, while i varies over all w. for each b, equation 17 goes over one column of r. equation 18 is a generalization of equation 15. in equation 18, r = r ( h ) is a matrix of basis bcvs with dim ( r ) = n n, v = v ( h ) is an h - relative version of r with dim ( v ) = n n and v is zero on rows i in h, and s = s ( h ) is a blocked component of h - relative bcp with dim ( s ) = n n. note that v is much sparser than original r and can reside on disk in an encoded and / or compressed form. also, computing h - relative [ v, s ] is faster than computing a full r, as is the case with h - relative computing. equation 18 and a program or system that operates according to equation 18 relates three matrices that can be solved with respect to r. this provides a way to restore r from cheap and encoded objects. since equation 18 implies equation 19, this reduces to equation 20 where k = ( i n n s ) 1 is the n n matrix inverse to a diagonally dominant matrix ( i n n s ). r ( i n n s ) = i n n + v ( equ. 19 ) when matrix s has decreasing powers ( as is the case in practice ), the result of equation 21 is obtained. k = i n n + s + s 2 + s 3 +. . . + s k +. . . ( equ. 21 ) if all that is needed is linear combinations of r ( h ), no further computation is needed. the developed apparatus is applicable to a more general non - hub specific bcv p of the previous section corresponding to any b h. it can be decodable from a partial v. substituting equation 20 into equation 16, the result is shown in equation 22. in other words, instead of fetching in longer columns of r as required by equation 16, i / o can be limited to much smaller columns of v ( stored in encoded form ) per equation 22. matrix k can be kept in core memory. in addition, computing relative data [ v, s ] is much faster than computing the original r. these improvements come with the price of extra multiplication by k. some accuracy can be expected to be lost in the process. additional efficiencies can be obtained using loop factors. above, potential generalizations ( e. g., non - uniform distribution for larger w ) were described, along with improvements ( e. g., accessing larger pairs in the queue ). in this section, a device that further speeds bcv computing is described. imagine that during the process of color distribution started at page b, the page b is encountered again. it means that the whole process mirrors itself. it does not go on forever because the process starts with w = 1, and potentially hits b again with a much smaller w. since propagation of w occurs only above certain threshold, the process eventually stops. in practice, especially for a highly connected starting node b, it actually gets a secondary hit. the process can be sped up by saving on looping by accumulating the entire color amount f that ever returns to b instead of propagating it along the way that generated loops in the first place. let p represent the vector computed by only propagating the initial color weight ( w = 1 ) and holding ( not propagating ) the color weight f that returns to b. the only input to its b & # 39 ; s component is done at the very first step : p b =. then p ( b ) = p + f p ( b ) and the result is shown in equation 23. in practice, an authority vector is used for ranking and so only relative magnitudes are important. however, if the bcvs are normalized ( in l1 ) to be a distribution, the result is as shown in equation 24. this equation allows finding a factor f, or a loop factor. notice that the rationale to eliminate looping is similar to relevant computing modulo { b } itself. notice that, by the same token, matrix s in equation 18 may be done to have zero diagonal. dangling pages are dealt with easily with bcp color amounts that propagate to them are simply discarded. equations 12 - 13 always hold for a bcv, but only hold for conventional page ranking when there are no dangling pages. in reality, the modification described by equation 5 artificially introduces a looping into a page ranking analysis. from a variety of ways to modify the random surfer model to handle dangling pages, that modification is unique in the sense that it provides for equality of ideal prv and bcv. this section shows how bookmark - coloring vectors lead to a natural search personalization. different views on search personalization coexist and could be equally useful. one view is that certain personalizable queries ( e. g., frequent queries having multiple meanings, or potential background information such as jaguar or pizza restaurant ) can be treated differently based on a user profile. for example, of different query extensions the one ( s ) fitting a user profile attributes ( as preferential topics or location ) can be substituted. this approach is good, since it actually tries to utilize user profile. it has its problems as well : ( a ) it is limited to special queries ; ( b ) it partially intersects with query disambiguation process, ( c ) it relies on user profile, which is hard to mine, and ( d ) it can actual shift a focus contrarily to a user desire. personalization can be thought of as of a process orthogonal to query disambiguation. in its most pure form, it abandons mining user profile data. instead, the user explicitly indicates desired preferences in terms of a few selected bookmarks. for example, a query jaguar can still result in multiple topics, but be personalized by a geographic location both for cats and dealerships. this location is not extracted from the user profile, but implicitly influenced by bookmarks connectivity information. a url of a local paper would be an example. this approach is more flexible with regard to potential attributes, since bookmarks cover many potential preferences. for example, a query with a clearly defined topic, as free trade, can be personalized not by its extensions, but by political orientation of a requester. a bookmark corresponding to conservative / liberal web sites can be instrumental in this regard. this pure formulation can be blended with any other approach that results in a user - specific set of bookmarks. assume some mechanism allows a user to select and maintain a set of bookmarks with associated weights. it could be a direct user interface or some other mapping from topical, user profile, or any other information. as a pure component ( an object with api ) this approach has several advantages : 1 ) its core does not require blending with any other technologies ( ir, linguistic analysis, or predictive classifiers ), but is purely based on w connectivity ; 2 ) it does not access user profile data, or deal with a query, but purely relies on a simple input personalization object a set of bookmarks with their weights ; 3 ) it allows an effective straightforward ui : the user can nominate some bookmarks ( probably emphasizing them with non - negative weights or other measures ) ; and 4 ) input of bookmarks can be updated instantaneously. thus, the results of such personalization are available and can be evaluated online. resulting coefficients are reusable ( they are, so to speak, personalization cookies ). two sets of bookmarks can easily interact : corresponding bcvs can be combined linearly. consider the following example. suppose a web graph represents a collection of over one billion pages and a user has hundreds of bookmarks. a bcv can be computed for those inputs and used to order the user & # 39 ; s search results. because of the sparseness condition, the bcv can be expected to be sparse in that all but a few hundred thousand components of the bcv will be zero. because of linearity ( or other superimposability characteristic ), bcvs can be precomputed and used to more quickly calculate a user - specific bcv, a set of authority weights. a set of 10, 000 or so popular bookmarks could have bcvs computed therefor and used where each user includes them. thus, a space of a million users with one hundred bookmarks might have ten thousand bookmarks representing 80 % of the space and 20 % taken up by less popular bookmarks, which can be processed and combined with precomputed bcvs for the more popular bookmarks. while the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, one skilled in the art will recognize that numerous modifications are possible. for instance, instead of a network of web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges, bcp could be applied to a social network, wherein individuals and / or entities are nodes and the relationships between them are the edges. resulting data structures, such as bcvs, hub basis bcvs and / or hub skeletons might be stored on a server or a client. the embodiments described herein may make reference to web sites, links, and other terminology specific to instances where the world wide web ( or a subset thereof ) serves as the search corpus. it should be understood that the systems and processes described herein can be adapted for use with a different search corpus ( such as an electronic database or document repository ) and that results may include content as well as links or references to locations where content may be found. in some embodiments, bcvs can be calculated to consider topic - specific teleportation. thus, although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that the invention is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the following claims.","in a search processing system , identifying input authority weights for a plurality of pages , wherein an input authority weight represents a user &# 39 ; s weight of a page in terms of interest ; distributing a page &# 39 ; s input authority weight over one or more pages that are linked in a graph to the page ; and using a resulting authority weight for a page in effecting a search result list . the search result list might comprise one or more of reordering search hits and highlighting search hits ."

"fig1 provides hardware that obtains novel control of the c / r method for correcting erroneous data requested from main storage ( ms ) 11 by a requestor, which may be a cpu ( central processing unit ), an i / 0 processor that is controlling one or more i / 0 devices, or a service processor ( sp ). each request for data sends an address to ms for accessing a line of data in ms dram arrays comprising a memory in a computer system. the invention may be applied to any memory, but the preferred embodiment uses the main storage ( ms ) in a computer system. each request provides the ms address of a requested data line in ms and the requestor & # 39 ; s identifier ( rid ), which is provided to the memory controller. each data line in ms 11 contains one or more data units ( dus ), of which each data unit is a group of data bits over which an error correcting code ( ecc ) is generated to provide a total group of bits indicated by the notation du + ecc group. the ecc bits in a group are commingled among the du bits, and the ecc bits enable sec / ded for its group during its readout and transmission. in the preferred embodiment each data line is comprised of sixteen du + ecc groups. the bits in a du + ecc group are readout and transmitted in parallel on a memory bus in the preferred embodiment, but they may be serially transmitted on a bus for the current data line. also, the preferred embodiment presumes each du is a double word of 64 data bits having 8 ecc bits providing sec / ded. hence, the 64 + 8 = 72 bits are transferred on the bus in parallel. if a serial bus were used, each du + ecc group would be assembled / disassembled into its parallel bit form to and from memory. in the hardware of fig1 each of the 16 du + ecc groups in a requested data line is transferred from ms 11 through inverter circuits 12 to an ecc logic circuit 13. during an original fetch, each group passes through inverter 12 in its true ( non - inverted ) form to ecc logic circuit 13. circuit 13 error checks each du + ecc group and passes it to its requestor, whether the ecc logic found it error - free or not. if a du + ecc group has only one erroneous bit, it is error corrected before being sent to the requestor. status information is sent with the data to the requestor to inform the requestor of the group & # 39 ; s error - free or particular error condition. if the requestor receives error - free data ( whether or not ecc corrected ), the c / r function is bypassed ( not done for the request ). a particular status signal identifies any detected error condition to the requestor for the sent du + ecc group, so that the requestor can determine what it wants done with the request, including whether the requestor will request the c / r method to be performed on the erroneous du + ecc group. the flow diagram of fig8 shows the steps in an original fetch operation for a data line request, in which step 1 represents the current request. step 2 represents when the fetch request obtains priority from the memory controller, which involves putting the request into memory request register 71 in fig4 from which addresses are generated for each du + ecc group in ms. step 3 is the generation of status information which is put into registers 73 and 74 in fig6 and 7, which are located in the memory controller for ms 11. register 73 in fig6 represents the status information sent to the requestor and has the following fields set by ecc circuits 13 : a requestor identifier ( rid ) of the processor which made the request, the 72 bits of the fetched du + ecc group, and the following single bit indicator fields : no error, 1 bit corrected error, excessive error, and a special ue ( uncorrected error ) indicator. the special ue is a unique character stored in a memory location to represent that the location had bad unrecoverable data due to an error. register 74 in fig7 represents the status information sent to a service processor ( sp ) which is also set by ecc circuits 13 with the same information as is put into register 73, except that register 74 also has a field set with the ecc syndrome bits for the group. by providing the syndrome bits to the sp, the sp has the option of using the syndrome bits and other status information to verify the ecc operation, if required. for an original fetch, the fields h - h, h - s and s - s in registers 73 and 74 are not generated ( remain off in reset state ) in the status registers. in step 4 of fig8 the status information in register 73 is communicated to the requestor indicated in the rid field, which is the fetch request currently represented in register 71 in fig4. the requestor may be a cpu, an i / o processor, or a service processor. each requestor has hardware for receiving and sensing the received status information and determining if further action is needed for continuing the storage request with the c / r method if an excessive error is reported in the status register information. in the preferred embodiment, if the requestor receives an excessive error indication in the status register, the requestor automatically makes a re - fetch request to ms, which is a request for invoking the c / r method to attempt a correction of the excessive error in that du + ecc group. status register 74 in fig7 has its contents transmitted to a service processor ( sp ) such as exists in the processor control element ( pce ) of an ibm 3090 system. the sp controls the error recovery operations for the system when required for an ms error condition, such as if an unrecoverable failure occurs in the hardware handling the request. for example if an error condition occurs in handling of the du + ecc group, the sp may cause a special ue character to be written into the location containing the erroneous group to prevent the bad data from being used. if a requestor ( receiving the status register information for an original fetch request ) finds the no error field is on, no response is provided and the requestor uses the received group. but if the excessive error indication is received, a re - fetch request ( sometimes called a redo request ) is the response provided to the ms controller by the requestor & # 39 ; s hardware / microcode. the re - fetch request invokes the c / r hardware in fig1 in an attempt to correct the erroneous du ( currently being addressed by register 71 ). no interruption is caused to the normal operation of ms 11 or to the requesting processor during the process of issuing a re - fetch request invoking the c / r method. the successful use of the c / r process without an interruption to the requesting processor provides significant novelty for the subject invention over the prior art. previously, an interruption to the requesting processor always occurred on sensing an excessive error condition ( 2 bit error with sec / ded ecc ) during which the sp was invoked to initiate and control the execution of the c / r method. a significant amount of processor time was lost in that prior process compared to the process of the subject invention. the following table represents the four states of the c / r sequencer shown in fig4 and some of their consequences including the restoration actions needed for restoring an erroneous du + ecc group to its original state in ms if a failure should occur in the c / r hardware before its completion of the c / r process. table du + du + ecc ecc du + ecc form in form in restoration action data buf ms at for retry during at end end of ( assures du +

/ r method is provided in response to a re - fetch request being handled by the memory controller, providing a c / r request from the requestor to sequencer 72 in fig5. normally, the four states of the c / r method proceed in sequence and complete with the second store state, as long as the hardware used by the c / r method operates correctly. if a malfunction signal occurs during any state of the c / r method ( indicated by the output state signal of sequencer 72 ), the malfunction signal causes a suppression of any further steps in the c / r process and invokes a restoration operation to assure the restoration of the du + ecc group being processed to its original state in ms. this is because the du + ecc group may be stored in a complemented ( inverted ) form in its original ms location at the end of the 1st store and 2nd fetch states of the c / r process. the particular data restoration action depends on which step of the c / r process existed when suspension occurred. then the restored erroneous du + ecc group enables it to be retried again to a potential corrected state. without restoration, a retry of the c / r method may not be able to correct the erroneous du + ecc group, and would prohibit confidence in the correction ability of the c / r method. fig9 and 10 show detailed flow diagrams of the c / r method used in the preferred embodiment, and represent the c / r steps in the table in more detailed substeps. step 10 in fig9 represents a re - fetch request selected by the ms controller for accessing in register 71, wherein requests are prioritized and may be pipeline delayed before becoming the current ms request in address register 71. hence, many machine cycles may intervene between the time a fetch or re - fetch request is issued and the time its is performed by ms 11, due to conventional priority selection being done for ms operations. that is, other fetch and store requests to ms 11 may be serviced during this intervening period. re - fetch requests usually get higher priority than fetch requests in the memory controller. step 10 in fig9 represents a re - fetch request being put into register 71 for activating the input & # 34 ; c / r request from requestor & # 34 ; to the c / r sequencer 72 in fig5 is set it to its 1st fetch output state. step 11 in fig9 represents the fetching of each du + ecc group from ms. step 12 represents the generation by circuits 13 of a & # 34 ; status bit & # 34 ;, s, and a parity bit, p, for each du + ecc group. bit s is generated as a copy of the & # 34 ; excessive error bit & # 34 ; field in the received status register information for the current du + ecc group. the status bit has a zero state if no excessive error is indicated, but it has a one state if an excessive error is indicated. and circuits 13 generate a parity bit, p, for each status bit. the parity bit may be generated with either even or odd parity. odd parity is used in the preferred embodiment. therefore, when the status bit is 1, the parity bit is zero, and visa versa, in the embodiment. in step 14 the status bit and its parity bit ( s, p ) generated for each du + ecc group are copied into s and p fields in an inpointer addressed entry in each of two separate status buffers ( status buffer1 and status buffer2 ). the corresponding entries in buffers 1 and 2 receive identical status bit and parity bit states. the inpointers for the data buffer 21 and for the status buffers 1 and 2 all address corresponding entries in their respective buffers and all are incremented at the same time during the first fetch operation. the c / r method is only invoked if a status bit, s, is set to a 1 state ( to indicate an excessive error ) for at least one du + ecc group of the 16 du + ecc groups in the current ms data line being read into the data buffer. generally, most of the du + ecc groups in the data buffer will not be erroneous and their respective s bits will be set to zero state to indicate no error in the corresponding du + ecc group stored in data buffer. a 1 value of the s bit for any du + ecc group controls both inversions for the bits in that group in the c / r hardware of fig1. thus a 0 value for the status bit ( indicating no error ) does not cause any inversion ( complementing ) of the group as it moves though the hardware in fig1. see step 26. step 15 represents the storing of each du + ecc group in data buffer 21 at the inpointer location. in step 16, the inpointer is incremented and the next du + ecc group is read from ms into the next entry in data buffer 21, until all 16 groups are written into the data buffer for the data line currently being addressed by the memory address register 71 in fig4. step 18 tests if any error has been detected in the c / r processing hardware, and if an error is detected, the c / r process is suppressed and the du + ecc group in ms is restored to its original state existing before the start of the suppressed c / r processing. if step 18 finds no operational error, the c / r processing continues with step 19 incrementing the c / r state sequencer to its 1st store output state. in fig1 outpointers 3, 2 and 1 are provided for the data buffer 21 and the two status buffers 2 and 1 to control the selection of the corresponding entries being outputted. during the 1st store state, the outpointers are incremented at the same time by step 25 to all have the same address in order to point to their corresponding entries in their respective stacks. steps 21, 22 and 23 perform check operations on these pointers and on the contents of their accessed entries to detect any hardware error that might have occurred. initially, the inpointers and the outpointers address the first du + ecc group in the data buffer ( and its respective status buffer entries ) of the current data line. as soon as plural du + ecc groups are stored in plural entries in the data buffer ( along with their corresponding status and parity bits in corresponding entries in the status buffers 1 and 2 ), the inpointers will increment ahead of the outpointers, and the outpointer addressed entries can be outputted from the respective buffers as long as the inpointer value is ahead of the outpointer value. the outpointer addressed du + ecc group is outputted from the outpointer data stack entry to an inverter 32 in fig1. the corresponding outputted value of the s bit from either status buffer 1 or 2 ( they are the same as long as they are not in error ) is used to control all inversion operations in fig1 upon the du + ecc group being outputted under the outpointer control. the value of the outputted s bit is registered in circuits 43 for the duration of the current c / r processing. if the registered s bit has a 1 value, it activates an inversion control signal on lines 44 to inverter 32 and inverter 12 ( which causes an inversion of the du + ecc bits on the first store and on the second fetch ). if the s bit is 0 for the currently outputted du + ecc group, no inversion is done for the respective du + ecc. step 26 cause an inversion ( complementing ) of the current outpointer group in inverter 32 if a 1 state exists for corresponding s bit. then step 27 disables and passes the du + ecc group through ecc logic circuits 33 and stores the group into the same ms location from which it was fetched. inverter 32 does not invert the du + ecc group if the corresponding s bit is 0. ecc logic 33 does not operate on the group during the 1st store operation. the outpointer incrementing will control the storing of all du + ecc groups into the data line in ms, in which only the group ( s ) having an excessive error ( s = 1 ) are in inverted form in ms upon the completion of the first storing step of the c / r method. step 28 checks if the stores occurred without any failure in the hardware of the c / r processing for the 1st store operations. if a failure is detected, step 29 is entered for activate the restoration required for a failure during the 1st store state of the c / r processing, indicated in the above table. if the 1st store is found to have completed successfully, step 31 is executed to increment the c / r sequencer 71 to its 2nd - fetch state to initiate the 2nd fetch of the data line now stored in ms with one or more of its du + ecc groups being in complemented form. in the second fetch, the inpointer 3 operates the same as it did in the 1st fetch operations to access each du + ecc group in the data line being addressed by register 71. inpointers 1 and 2 are not used in the second fetch operation. thus, step 51 accesses each du + ecc group in the current data line being addressed by register 71. steps 54, 55 and 56 perform check operations for the c / r hardware, which are discussed later. in the second fetch, the outpointers 1 and 2 operate differently from the first fetch, and instead address the status buffer entries having the s bit corresponding to the current du + ecc group being read from ms into the data buffer at the inpointer 3 location. in the second fetch, the outpointers 1 and 2 step together with inpointer 3, although the incrementing of inpointer 3 may occur a cycle or two later when there are corresponding buffering delays in the ecc circuits 13. outpointer 3, on the other hand, controls the 2nd store operation for du + ecc groups in the data buffer earlier obtained by the 2nd fetch operation, so that the 2nd store operation can overlap the 2nd fetch operation. the outpointers 1 and 2 address the status buffer entries 1 and 2 to access the s bit for each du + ecc group being read from ms, in order to control the operation of inverter 12 while the respective group is passing through inverter 12 to execute step 57 in fig1. the outpointers 1 and 2 are initially set to address the first du + ecc group to be readout to control the required inversion state of inverter 12. then outpointers 1 and 2 are incremented for the next du + ecc group to be readout, etc. each accessed s bit in the status buffers ( which was generated during the first fetch ) is used again without change during the second fetch to control the second inversion of each erroneous du + ecc group to obtain correction of all hard errors in the group during the second fetch operation. thus, the order of the s bits in each status buffer is the order of the respective du + ecc groups readout of the data line put in ms by the 1 st store operation. step 58 in fig1 increments outpointers 1 and 2 just prior to each next du + ecc group being fetched in ms, so that the corresponding s bit is effective to control inverter 12 operation for the group being read from ms. in fig1, the paths from step 58 to step 61, and from step 58 to step 71 are simultaneously taken. in the first path, the sec / ded ecc circuits 13 detect for error conditions remaining in the current du + ecc group after the second inversion in the c / r method has corrected all existing hard errors. step 61 determines for the current group : 1 ) if an h - h condition exists because the ecc did not correct any error, or 2 ) if an h - s condition exists because the ecc corrected 1 error, or 3 ) if an s - s uncorrectable condition exists because the ecc could not corrected the existing error condition. step 63 sets the corresponding 1 bit field in registers 73 and 74, which are required for use by the system error reporting process in fig1. then, step 68 sends the status register contents to the requestor and to the sp, which includes sending to the requestor all 16 data units comprising the fetched data line. the parallel path continues with step 71 storing the current du + ecc group in the data buffer at the current inpointer 3 location, and then pointer 3 is incremented by step 72. next step 73 tests whether the second fetch has completed without an error condition is the c / r hardware processing, which is a different type of error condition from the error conditions detected in the du + ecc group by step 61. if a c / r processing error occurred, step 88 is entered to restore the current du + ecc group in ms for conditions existing at the end of the 2nd fetch. if no c / r processing error occurred, step 74 increments the c / r sequencer 72 to its last state, 2nd store. each group was written into the data buffer in its true state, since erroneous group ( s ) now has been double inverted and non - erroneous du + ecc groups were never inverted. then step 81 write each group into ms from the outpointer 3 location in the data buffer without any inversion. outpointer 3 ( unlike outpointers 1 and 2 ) operates in the same manner as it did for the first store in the c / r method, in which outpointer 3 is initially reset to the first entry in the data buffer, and is incremented after each du + ecc group is outputted from the entry. however, no s bit control is used in the 2nd store operation, so that there is no need for any s bit alignment with the data buffer entries as there was during the 1st store operation. and therefore none of the other pointers operates in synchronously with outpointer 3. step 82 increments outpointer 3 after each group is outputted. accordingly, during the 2nd store operation, the entire data line exists in its true and original state in the data buffer, and after the 2nd store operation is completed, all groups in the data line remain in their true and original state in ms, except that any group only having a single soft error can be corrected by scrubbing. hence, the groups in ms will still have all hard errors, and all soft errors when more than one soft error existed in a group. accordingly, the c / r error correction process is completed, if no error occurred in the c / r processing hardware. to achieve a high degree of confidence in the fault - tolerance of the c / r hardware, novel means are provided to detect a failure in the operation of the c / r hardware. it is possible for an alpha particle to cause a soft error in any bit in any buffer entry, and in any pointer register. also it is possible to have a hard error in these same bit positions. a number of error checks are made in this embodiment while it is in operation to increase the fault tolerance of the c / r method. the status buffers and the data buffer each have an inpointer and an outpointer for use during writing and reading respectively. there are times when all inpointers must step in unison ( during the first fetch ) and all outpointers must step in unison ( during the first store ). at other times, only the two inpointers of the status buffers must step in unison ( during the second fetch when the outpointer of the data buffer is not in use ), and the two outpointers of the status buffers must step in unison. when one of the pointers is out of step, an attempt is made to recover the originally stored state of the du + ecc group and a retry of the c / r operation is made. the values of inpointers 1 and 2 are always supposed to be the same, which is check by comparator 41. likewise the values of outpointers 1 and 2 are always supposed to be the same, and they are checked by comparator 42. if comparator 41 or 42 ever finds an unequal condition, an error is detected, and the comparator then outputs an interruption signal to the requesting processor and to the sp. also the current erroneous du + ecc group is restored as indicated in the above table so the c / r method can be retried on that group. if the inpointers are out of step during the first fetch, there is no damage to the data in main storage. therefore, it is simply a matter of sending an interruption signal to the requestor for it to request a retry of the c / r method from its beginning. if the outpointers are out of step during the first store, an interruption signal will be generated to abort the first store to preserve the data in main storage. then the c / r method is retried in its entirety. if the outpointers of the two status buffers are out of step during the second fetch, an interruption signal is generated to abort the second fetch. since the reading of the status buffers and ms are non - destructive reads, the content of ms and the status buffers are assumed to be un - changed. therefore, recovery is possible by a retry of the second fetch or second store c / r sequence. when these out - of - step interruptions frequently occur within a given time interval, the hardware involved in the c / r method is assumed to be unreliable and must be replaced immediately. on each access to the status buffers 24 and 27 by their inpointers and by their outpointers, the accessed status and parity bits ( s, p ) are suppose to be the same, and they are also compared for equality in a comparator in circuits 43. if the compared s, p values are ever different, an error is indicated and an interruption signal is sent to the requesting processor and to the sp. also circuits 43 do a parity - check of the s, p content of each accessed status buffer entry for detecting any parity error condition. if the parity check is bad in one of the status buffer entries, the s bit in the other corresponding status buffer entry is used for the inversion control explained above if its parity is correct. the redundancy of the status buffer allows the c / r operation to proceed in case the accessed entry of one status buffer has a parity error and the accessed entry of the other status buffer has good parity. however, when parity errors are detected in the accessed entries of both status buffers, the c / r operation must be halted as soon as possible and an interrupt is sent to the sp for assistance. if this interrupt occurs during the first store, the store operation is aborted immediately to preserve the original data in ms. at this point, the content of the status buffers and data buffers can be reloaded by re - executing the c / r operation in its entirety. if this interrupt occurs during the second fetch, the c / r operation suffers an unrecoverable failure because the status bits cannot indicate, due to parity errors, whether the du + ecc in ms has been complemented or not. as a result, a special ue character will be stored in ms at the address involved with the c / r operation to indicate a bad, unrecoverable block of data. before storing the status bits, each status buffers checks the status bits for good parity. the status bits that have a bad parity will be written into the status buffer with a default value of ` 0 ` and its parity of ` 1 `. this action is taken to ensure that all entries in the status buffers have good parity at the end of the first fetch. the default s bit does not cause any inversion and prevents the c / r method from operating on that group. in more detail during the first fetch, the outpointers 1, 2 and 3 are compared to ensure that the outpointers always step in unison. any discrepancy among the outpointers will cause an error signal to be generated noting failure of operation. however during the second fetch, only the outpointers 1 and 2 of the two status buffers are compared since they do not step in unison with outpointer 3. this is done in fig9 by steps 21, 22 and 23, and in fig1 by steps 54, 55 and 56. the completed results of the c / r method are passed to the requestor as corrected data or as uncorrected data ( such as the detection of two soft errors, or of a special ue ). the reporting process in fig1 greatly reduces the amount and frequency of reporting excessive errors to operating system software ( os ), and eliminates all interruptions for a hard error in a memory unit, e. g. a 4 kb page, that was previously reported. the reporting process in fig1 is invoked when the requestor receives status information ( shown in fig6 ) indicating an excessive error exists in the requested data line. this embodiment provides a novel table called an ltr ( logical track record ), which is located in a storage area only accessible to microcode. the ltr includes a set of reporting bits, one for each ms data unit ( e. g. 4kb page ). microcode in the requesting processor accesses the ltr to determine if reporting is needed for the currently detected excessive error condition provided by status information after the second fetch in the c / r method. three different monitoring processes are represented in fig1, and their selection is dependent on which type of excessive error is being reported, which can be any one of the s - s, h - h, h - s and special ue cases, which represent different cases of hard and soft error detection by the c / r method. the h - h and h - s cases each indicate the addressed page is stored in bad ms hardware. then a bit in the ltr is accessed using the page address of the data line having the currently detected excessive error. if the accessed ltr bit is set on, the yes path 91 is taken which indicates an excessive error was previously reported for that page, and that no communication with os is needed for the currently detected excessive error, so that no processor interruption is generated. but if no error has been reported for this page, then the no path is taken which sets the ltr bit and causes an mc interruption that sets bit 17 in the machine check interrupt code ( mcic ) to communicate to os the first excessive hard error in the page. the s - s case does not indicate any bad hardware in the addressed page, but that soft errors were detected in it. soft errors indicate bad data ( which may be in good hardware ). an excessive soft error must be reported each time it occurs, which is done by causing a machine check interruption that sets bit 16 and resets bit 32 in the mcic to communicate the soft error to os. if the ltr bit is set on in the s - s path and later a hard error is detected in the same page causing an entry into the h - h or h - s path in fig1, the ltr bit for that page will have been set on so that path 91 is taken which avoids any interruption to the requesting processor due to the c / r processing. thus, when the process on path 91 in fig1 is taken, it eliminates the two clock - stopping interruptions ( to the processor and to the memory ) which occurred in the prior art operation of the c / r method. the first interruption occurred on the invocation of the c / r method, and the second interruption occurred on the determination of the type of excessive error being detected. this invention eliminates the first type of interruption and greatly reduces the second type of interruption. the special ue ( uncorrectable error character ) indicates that bad data was put into its location, which was stored as a special ue data pattern. the special ue ( when fetched ) causes a machine check interruption which sets bits 16 and 32 in the mcic to communicate the special ue to os. although the preferred embodiment is disclosed in connection with the main storage, it is understood the present invention may be used with other storages such as expanded storage or key storage and by other requestors such as vector processors. where we have illustrated and described the preferred embodiment of our invention, it is to be understood that we do not limit ourselves to the precise construction herein disclosed, and the right is reserved to all changes and modifications

"aspects of the exemplary embodiment relate to a system and method for providing the ability to modify a document using natural language commands through a user interface. natural language commands are particularly friendly for user interaction because the user identifies with the particular description in a familiar language. however, not all users may be familiar with the particular language. therefore, human readable sentences identified by the user are provided in an interface that allows users to select portions of the sentences for creating complete sentences designating how a document are modified. various image modifications can be implemented within the user interfaces. for example, color modifications, object modifications, and / or picture modifications, such as blurriness, sharpness, etc. consequently, the present disclosure is not limited to any specific type of modification, although the disclosure refers mainly to image modifications involving color as one example of the image modifications implemented within the system and methods herein. colors vary greatly in how they are designated. thus, in one embodiment a user selects a color for an image modification to be implemented within the user & # 39 ; s document. the colors are presented, for example, within an easy to use text - based interface under certain categories simply designed for eliciting a selection from a user for a specific color to be modified. for example, the categories may be titled with a question for eliciting a response from the user, and the colors may be selections presented as options for the user to select from among the categories. the selections may be color selections that are in the form of patches of colors or a color sample among a palette of colors that are presented. further, the selection can comprise a text description of the particular color to compliment the color sample. this provides the advantage of eliminating some of the ambiguity with language, but allows an interface utilizing natural language to identify a selected color desired by users to be adjusted in a document, which may be any type of document ( e. g., a photo image, a text document, presentation, etc. ). a human readable sentence representing a natural language command identifies the image modification to be generated through a natural language control system. where a human readable sentence, for example, may be make greens a lot more blue, the sentence generated becomes a command for mapping changes to regions of color space within the document. for example, affecting the regions of blue in a document to make them a lot more green. this concept will be discussed in more detail infra with respect to the methods and apparatus disclosed. an image modification is based on the type of change to be modified in a document or the particular image within the document, the magnitude of the modification desired, and the resultant image modification ( i. e., the direction of the modification within the document ). for example, any color selected from the category of colors presented designates which color to be modified in a user document. as stated above, this color is selected from among color selections presented under a category of a text - based interface. for example, certain purples may be selected either from colors extracted out of the document and presented within a category for selecting the color to be modified or a number of predefined patches or color samples are presented. these samples may include a range of samples under each color. the range of purples, for example, comprises various purples of differ characteristics comprising various spectral characteristics, brightness values, hues, and / or saturation amounts. the colors provide different textures, such as glossy, grainy, fuzzy, etc. additionally, the colors in the range of purples, for example, provide various shades considered within the purple spectrum of visible colors from which the user may choose from. any number of colors therefore is selected for a color modification within the document. the colors can be predefined or extracted from the document for populating the category presented to the user for selection. in another embodiment, objects within the document or properties of the image within the document may also be modified in a similar fashion. the disclosure is not limited to color. the magnitude of change for a modification designates the amount or intensity in which the modification is implemented within the user & # 39 ; s document. for example, natural color languages use additional words to describe color differences, and thus, the magnitude of the modification is specified in combination with the color selected. for example, phrases or words, such as slightly less, a lot more, a little more, a smidgen more, etc. can designate the intensity or amount in which the image modification is implemented. for example, if the user selects a shade of green, for example, under a first text - based category, and then selects a lot more in another second category, then this designates to modify these particular shades of greens in the document with a higher intensity of green. the disclosure, however, is not limited to any specific phrase or words, in any particular language, and / or does not preclude mathematical phrases or symbols, or other designations for a language, and / or color samples and symbols. additionally, a direction for the modification is a resultant image modification, in which the modification should be made towards within the document. for example, the user may first select a particular shade of green within the user & # 39 ; s document for modification, and then, the user may select a magnitude or intensity ( e. g., a lot ) for the modification under a second category, and finally, the user selects the direction in which the color modification should occur, which is the resultant color for adjustment towards ( e. g., blue ). a sentence is created that designates a complete and specific color modification to be implemented in the user & # 39 ; s document that would make greens a lot more blue, for example. consequently, the human readable sentence is representative of a natural language command for generating the particular image modification to be made to the document. for example, the sentence in the above example would read a shade of green a lot more blue, if blue was the direction selected for green colors within the document to be modified. fig1 illustrates one embodiment of an exemplary user interface system 100 for editing a user document. the system 100 comprises a processor 114 coupled to an image input device 116. the device comprises any device capable of executing a set of logical instructions and can comprise, for example, a computer, a personal digital assistant ( fda ), digital camera, cell phone, printer, copier, or the like. such devices can include the user interface 100, which may further comprise, but is not limited to, a key board, microphone, pointing device, display, speakers, audio / visual inputs / outputs network connections and / or other devices of the device 116 and / or processor 114. the image input device 116 is configured to receive a document 112 for a color modification to be made by a user through the interface 100. the image input device 116 comprises a memory 120 for storing the document 114. a natural language control ( nlc ) system 118 executed via the processor 114 of the device 116, which can map the colors and / or features of the document 112 to a working color space in order for modifications entered by the user to be affected therein. the nlc 118 will be discussed in further detail infra. a document can be provided by a user to an image processing system for processing images, such as a xerographic imaging system. the document may be any document, such a photo image, a text based document, or any document that may be printed, modified, and / or transferred in digital format, for example. a document may be any physical or digital representation of a body of information capable of being communicated to an output device for display, print, and / or alteration ( e. g., a photo, or presentation document ). a user display 110 is coupled to the image input device and may be any display or multiple displays for viewing a graphical user interface or the user interface system 100 as an lui. stored within memory 120 are images that are graphic images for representing the user document 112 and / or a set of thumbnail images 122 included. in general, each thumbnail image comprises image data derived from the respective document. usually, the thumbnail image 122 contains less information than the original document, but not always. for example, each thumbnail image 122 may be a reduced resolution and / or cropped, digital image generated from the original document or processed original document. all of the thumbnails in the set may be the same size. in some embodiments, the image may be otherwise digitally modified in creating the thumbnail, for example by conversion from color to monochrome ( e. g., a black and white thumbnail ). in other embodiments, a representative portion of the image is automatically selected as the thumbnail, avoiding the need for reducing resolution or resizing. indeed, the thumbnail can be any visual representation of the document which allows documents to be distinguished from each other in the set. in one embodiment, the thumbnail is a context - dependent image, as described, for example, in above - mentioned application ser. no. 12 / 049, 520 incorporated herein by reference. in such an approach, the portion of the image selected as the thumbnail may be dependent on the context in which the image is to be used. for example, if the user is known to be interested primarily in faces, a region of the image can be identified with suitable face recognition software and used as a basis for determining a suitable crop area. the user display 110 comprises a first view 102 that displays an image 106 of the system 100, which can be the actual document 112, or a thumbnail image 122. the thumbnail images 122 may be selected by a user for representation of the document 112 within the interface system 100. for example, the first view 102 is a preview of the image 106 selected via preview controls 126. a user may select a representative image similar to the document for color modification, for example. the first view 102 presents the image modifications in real time to the user as selections are entered. in addition, the modifications build upon one another, and thus, the effect of multiple modifications are displayed in the image 106 selected for the first view 102. the user interface 100 further comprises a second view 126 in which a text - based interface 102 is presented. in one embodiment, the text - based interface 102 is displayed alongside the image 106 for observing the modifications concurrently with receiving inputted commands at the text - based interface 102. the text - based interface 102 comprises categories for receiving input for an image modification thereat. the categories are text - based categories 108, for example. each of the categories represents a number of selections to be displayed within. a user selects a selection from each category in order for a human readable sentence to be comprised for representing a natural language command of a particular image modification, such as, for example, a color modification. the text - based interface 102 of the interface system 100 comprises a first text - based category 134, a second text - based category 136, and a third text - based category 138. the first text - based category 134 includes selections therein ( not shown ) for selecting which color to modify within the user & # 39 ; s document 110. for example, green may be selected or any other color may be selected. the second text - based category 136 includes selections therein that represent a magnitude ( e. g., intensity ) of the color modification. the third text - based category 138 includes selections for a resultant color or a direction for which the color modification is made. all three selections made within the first, second and third categories combine to form a human readable sentence effectuating a particular image modification. in one embodiment, each text - based category is presented in the form of a question. the first text - based category 108 is presented as an activated menu that is entitled with a question for eliciting a user & # 39 ; s input in a simple and easily conveyable manner. for example, the question illustrated in fig1 has a drop - down menu that inquires a user interacting with the interface the following : what color to change? a drop - down list is a user interface control gui element, similar to a list box, which allows the user to choose one value from a list. when a drop - down list is inactive, it displays a single value or a category title as illustrated. when activated, it displays ( drops down ) a list of values or selections, from which the user may select from. when the user selects a new value, the control can revert to its inactive state, displaying the selected value. the disclosure is not limited to any particular manner of drop - down list or the like. although one design actually places the list box below the box showing the single value or category title, many other user interface designs ( such as motif ) and aqua from mac os x place the list box so that the currently - selected item is at the location of the box, thus eliminating the need to move a pointer to pick the same value. this is sometimes called a popup list or a choice or chooser. a drop - down list differs from a combo box in that the entry portion of a drop - down list cannot be edited. many various designs may be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. an advantage of a drop - down list vs. a list box or tabs is that only one option is visible at a time and the box can be presented in the form of a question to elicit a portion of a color modification from a user from a list of selections or options. in addition, drop - down lists use far less space due to their show / hide functionality. referring to fig2, illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the user interface system 100. the text - based category 108 in this example questions the user for a color to be modified that is previewed within the image 102 and effectuating the user & # 39 ; s document. a selected color 128 might be cyan, for example. selections 130 provide multiple color samples with descriptions thereat for a user to select from. selections 132 for certain shades or classes of colors are additionally provided. in addition, selections ( not shown ) representing colors of various image properties ( e. g., hue, brightness, gloss, etc. ) can also be provided. fig3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of interface system 100 comprising human readable sentences 40. for example, a sentence 42 is displayed in a window 50, such as a scrollbar window, upon being compiled from the selections under the text - based categories 108. each of the text - based categories comprises a portion of the sentence 42. a color selection 160, for example, comprises the portion of the sentence selecting the color to be modified, namely cyan. additionally, a magnitude selection 162 comprises a portion of the sentence indicating an intensity of a lot more in which the color cyan should be adjusted. likewise, a resultant color selection 164 comprises a portion of the sentence indicating that cyan colors in the user & # 39 ; s document should be made a lot more zippy, for example. while zippy can be any color indicating a brownish - orange or a color known in the art comprising properties distinguishable from other color properties. each human readable sentence is presented for display to a user in the window 50 in an order in which each sentence affects the image modification in the image 106. in one embodiment, the user is capable of altering the order of the human readable sentences 40 for various expressions to result in priority in which modifications are implemented within the user & # 39 ; s document. referring back to fig1, a sorting engine 115 is configured to sort the human readable sentences 40 of fig3 corresponding to a respective modification. for example, the sentence 42 modifies cyan colors in the image 106 to make them a lot more zippy. the sentence 44 thereafter produces all yellow colors slightly more red. consequently, if zippy is meant to define a shade of yellow, then all cyan colors will be made a lot more yellow, and these regions within the color space of the document / image 106, in addition to other regions that were yellow already will be made more red. in one embodiment, the user can specify a priority of the sentences, such as via a control feature 168 and 170 ( e. g., an arrow button ) and / or delete a sentence at a delete 172 if the modification shown in the image 106 is not desirable. the arrows can move the sentences to provide a specified priority to each sentence, in which the modifications presented first, will be the first to be expressed within the image 106. an example methodology 700 for implementing a user interface system for modifying colors of a document is illustrated in fig7. while the method 700 is illustrated and described below as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the illustrated ordering of such acts or events are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense. for example, some acts may occur in different orders and / or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and / or described herein. in addition, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement one or more aspects or embodiments of the description herein. further, one or more of the acts depicted herein may be carried out in one or more separate acts and / or phases. at 702 a document is received from an image output device of a user interface system. the user interface system is configured to modify the document with imaging components using a natural language control system discussed in detail herein. at 704 an image modification is presented in real time within an image displayed in a first view of a display. concurrently, the image modification is received as input from a user. this input is provided to the user at 706 within a text - based interface that may be alongside the first display of real time modifications being presented. at 706 the text - based interface is presented with text - based categories corresponding to portions of a human readable sentence. in an exemplary embodiment, a first text - based category in the text - based interface provides various color selections for receiving a color to be modified in the document from the user. in addition, a second text - based category in the text - based interface provides selections for receiving a magnitude of the image modification or a resultant image modification. further, a third text - based category in the text - based interface provides selections that are different from the second text - based category for receiving the magnitude or the resultant image modification. for example, if the second text - based category provides selections for magnitude, the third text - based category can provide selections for the resultant image modification. at 708 more than one human readable sentence is displayed. the human readable sentences correspond to more than one image modification and may be displayed alongside the first view in a second view of the text based - interface to see modifications occur in the same display. at 710 the sentences are sorted from a specified ordering being received as input. the ordering has a corresponding priority in which the sentence can affect modifications in the order provided. sentences sorted with a higher priority in the specified ordering generate respective image modification in the image displayed first, before other modifications, and thus, can affect the image modification of subsequent sentences. the method illustrated in fig7 may be implemented in a computer program product that may be executed on a computer. the computer program product may be a tangible computer - readable recording medium on which a control program is recorded, such as a disk, hard drive, or may be a transmittable carrier wave in which the control program is embodied as a data signal. common forms of computer - readable media include, for example, floppy disks, flexible disks, hard disks, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic storage medium, cd - rom, dvd, or any other optical medium, a ram, a prom, an eprom, a flash - eprom, or other memory chip or cartridge, transmission media, such as acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications, and the like, or any other medium from which a computer can read and use. the exemplary method may be implemented on one or more general purpose computers, special purpose computer ( s ), a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements, an asic or other integrated circuit, a digital signal processor, a hardwired electronic or logic circuit such as a discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a pld, pla, fpga, or pal, or the like. in general, any device, capable of implementing a finite state machine that is in turn capable of implementing the flowchart shown in fig7, can be used to implement the method for editing images in a document. u. s. patent application ser. no. 11 / 479, 484 and u. s. patent application ser. no. 11 / 762, 155 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. portions have been reproduced below to provide detailed support in the present disclosure. a usable natural language control system could be created as described in the flowchart of fig4. the acts are listed in a particular order in the flowchart. however, this order should not be considered limiting, as the order of many of these acts may be changed without affecting the resulting color control system. first, a natural language color description dictionary of terms would be created and / or chosen from a set of pre - existing dictionaries 400. then a color space in which the transformations will be performed is chosen 410. the regions of the color space are then mapped to terms in the color dictionary 420. a dictionary of command terms also needs to be created or selected 430. in embodiments, a library of basic transforms in the color space corresponding to various command terms would also be generated 440. there would be a general mapping between particular transform forms and command forms. the details of a user command would be used to tailor a transform once it was selected from the library as described in more detail with respect to fig6. in addition to generating a lexicon of command terms, a syntax for using the command terms from the command dictionary in combination with the color terms of the color dictionary would be chosen as well 150. both of the command and color term dictionaries may simply be part of one big dictionary. fig5 illustrates an embodiment of a natural language color control and calibration system that a user would use to adjust an image or portion thereof. again, the acts are listed in a particular order in the flowchart. however, this order should not be considered limiting, as the order of many of these acts may be changed without affecting the resulting color control system. at 500, the user would select a subject. the subject may be, for example, a scanned or created image or a set of input colors of a multi - dimensional lookup table. the subject may also be a portion of an image. for example, the user may be able to identify a quadrant of an image or a particular object in an image that the user would want to adjust. the natural language system included herein also encompasses the ability to mark areas of an image to be adjusted using a point and click system. at 610, some or all of the selected subject would be mapped from the initial color space into the working color space of the color control system before or after the command is entered. the initial color space may be, for example, rgb on a display screen or cmyk on a printed document. for an image, for example, this may be a pixel - by - pixel mapping. however, many programs exist to reduce the time and processing power of such a mapping. for example, various algorithms use sampling techniques and / or allow a system to recognize uniform patches. the working color space could be any color encoding in which the color adjustment algorithms referenced in 530 are conveniently applied. in general, perceptually uniform, device independent color encodings are preferred as working spaces. the user also issues a verbal or written instruction to indicate the change required in the image at 520. this command may be entered before or after the image or portion of the image is mapped into the working color space. the language used for this instruction could be the natural language of the user or it might be a language defined or limited by the application ; e. g., the application may provide a user interface that could limit the language to a defined vocabulary or facilitate the parsing operation. at 530, the program would translate the entered verbal or written instruction into a color transform in the color working space. the program would contain a set of rules or instructions for parsing the instruction and implementing a transformation to the image corresponding to the user & # 39 ; s command. the natural language command may be parsed to separate the command into components such as, for example, a target or resultant color range specification 540, and a color modification specification 550. the target color range specification would include the color or colors to be modified. the target color range specification may also specifically identify colors that are not to be modified. the image adjustment would then be applied only to those colors that are included in the color range specified to be adjusted. in 560, an image mask would be created from the specified color range 540 and the image in the working color space. the image adjustment will therefore be applied only to those colors that are included in the mask. in embodiments, a particular color might be present in an area of overlapping regions of specified color ranges and therefore might be contained within two or more overlapping ranges. if the user were to enter verbal commands involving both these regions then the program make an internal logic decision based upon a set of preprogrammed rules. for example, the commands may be followed consecutively with the last command entered given priority over earlier commands. there are many methods, familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art, by which a mask can be created. one such method involves representing the specified color range as a subvolume of the working color space and then determining, for each pixel in the mapped image, if the color of the pixel is inside the specified color range subvolume. all such pixels inside the specified color range subvolume are in the mask while all pixels outside the specified color range subvolume are excluded from the mask. another method of creating the image mask is to associate with each color in the color name dictionary or dictionaries one or more prototypical locations ( points rather than subvolumes ) in the working color space. for each image pixel the nearest prototypical color name location is determined and those pixels with nearest prototypical locations associated with color names in the specified color range are included in the mask. pixels with a nearest prototypical location associated with color names not in the specified color range are excluded from the mask. while it is possible to map each individual pixel, algorithms exist to simplify such mappings. for example, various algorithms use sampling techniques and / or allow a system to recognize uniform patches. yet another alternative method to construct the mask is to construct a multidimensional lookup table, the input values of which sample the working color space. when the image pixel colors are mapped through this multi - dimensional lookup table the output values indicate whether the pixel are included in the mask or excluded from the mask. such an embodiment might result in output values between 0 and 1 where a value of 0 represents exclusion from the mask and a value of 1 represents inclusion in the mask. since multi - dimensional lookup tables generally use interpolation to determine output values the possibility of values between 0 and 1 exists. in such cases these fractional values could be retained, resulting in a fuzzy or blurred mask. in such a fuzzy or blurred mask pixels returning values between 0 and 1 would be considered to be partially included in the mask. pixels that are partially in the mask would undergo a partial image adjustment. alternatively, the output values might be rounded, or otherwise adjusted, to give only values of 0 or 1, thereby generating a binary mask. other methods for mapping such input terms into the working color space include, for example, use of voronoi partitions, other tessellation methods, and k - d trees. a general example of such a method, suitable for both convex and non - convex regions, comprises tessellating each named region in the color space with tetrahedral simplices. testing whether a given color lies inside any of the tetrahedra comprising the region will determine whether the color lies within the region. in the case of convex regions of the color space simpler tests not requiring tessellation of the region can be used. in 600, the natural language instruction is used to create a color adjustment transform. there are numerous methods by which such transforms could be constructed but in general all such methods will include the act of parsing the verbal color modification specification to determine 1 ) the magnitude of the desired modification, 2 ) the property that is to be modified and 3 ) the direction in which it is to be modified. these three pieces of information are a minimum requirement for any color adjustment transform. additional information might be required to more fully specify the required transform before it can be constructed. such additional information might be acquired from the pixels that are included in the mask. such pixel - related information might include color values and spatial locations. the values of individual pixels or population statistics might be used in transform construction. what follows is a general example of transform construction, using an example command or instruction language such as, for example, those discussed herein. the acts involved in this general example of transform construction are illustrated in fig6. first, a verbal color modification specification is parsed 610 to obtain verbal specifications for the color property to be modified 620, the magnitude of the color modification 630, and the direction of the color modification 640. the command, make the red colors slightly less saturated is first parsed per into a target color range specification 540 ( the red colors ), and a color modification specification 550 ( slightly less saturated ), as noted earlier. then, at act 600, the color modification specification is parsed into the color property to be modified 620 ( saturation ), the magnitude of the color modification 630 ( slightly ), and the direction of the color modification 640 ( less ). the verbal description of the color property to be modified is mapped to a numerical normalizing scale factor in step 650. this act allows for the magnitude specifications to be normalized such that the verbal descriptions of magnitude ( 630 ) correspond to equivalent or very similar perceptual changes in the target color regardless of the property that is being modified and regardless of the color being modified. for this example, the magnitude of color change requested is slight and this should lead to a perceptually similar slight change in the target red colors regardless of what perceptual property we are changing. perceptual properties can include, for example, saturation, lightness, darkness, colorfulness, chroma, hue, contrast, redness, greenness, yellowness, blueness, orange - ness, pink - ness, brown - ness, purple - ness, and grayness. additionally, one could modify any property that could be described as ( color - name ) - ness by moving the selected colors in a direction toward the prototypical location of ( color - name ). e. g., to increase the mauve - ness of a selection of colors move them toward the prototypical location of color name mauve. at 660, the verbal magnitude of the color modification is mapped onto a numerical magnitude value. generally, and in the interests of common sense, words that signify a larger magnitude would be mapped onto larger numerical magnitude values, but this is not a requirement. it is desirable however that the numerical magnitude scale, onto which magnitude words are mapped, corresponds linearly to the perceived magnitude that an average population, with normal color vision, associates with the verbal magnitude word or phrase. perceptual changes in a property will likely depend in part upon the color being modified and upon its initial scaled value in that property. for example, what constitutes a slight lessening of the saturation of reds in an image would likely be different if there was a low saturation of red in the image, then if there was a high saturation of red. in embodiments, the magnitude of a slight property change in the working color space would depend upon the context in which it was used. act 670 involves mapping the verbal direction to a numerical sign value ( + or ). this can be simply implemented by mapping the verbal direction to a multiplicative factor of + 1 for verbal indications that increase a property and 1 for verbal indications that decrease a property. the numerical values determined in 650, 660 and 670 are used as parameters in a color adjustment transform. this occurs in 690. generally a color adjustment transform will have some pre - determined functional form and the numerical values are applied to this functional form to control its specific effect on the colors. the choice of functional form of the color adjustment transform would be made in 680. the choice might be arbitrarily made by the application designer or the functional form might be algorithmically determined by, for example, the values of the color property to be modified, the verbal magnitude of the color modification and the verbal direction of the color modification. the program implementing converting the natural language command into a transform in the color working space may have a library of basic forms to map to different sets of user instructions. based upon the natural language command entered by the user, the program selects a functional form from this library. for example, one functional form might be chosen for lightness modifications and a different form chosen for chroma modifications. in this case, the functional form to which the numerical values determined in s 650, 660 and 670 are applied, would depend on the type of color property to be modified. as a trivial example of applying the numerical values to a functional form, consider the simple functional form of a linear mapping. such a mapping will have two parameters the slope of the line and an intercept. in this trivial example, the linear function would map the original value of the specified color property to a modified output value of that property. the slope of the line could be determined from the product of the values of the numerical normalizing scale factor, the numerical magnitude value and the numerical sign value. the intercept value of such a linear mapping would generally be zero, but might also be derived from the numerical magnitude value in special cases. more complex functional forms will generally require more parameters to define them. the numerical values determined in 650, 660 and 670 would therefore be used to determine the values of the parameters. the numerical values may simply be assigned to the parameters, or parameters may be determined by some mathematical modification of combination of the numerical values. returning to fig5, in 570, a modified color image is created by applying the color modification transform and the image mask created in 680 and 560 respectively to the original image. finally, the modified color image is then converted back to the original color space in 580. it will be appreciated that variants of the above - disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be combined into many other different systems or applications. various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.","methods and a system for a natural language control interface are provided to enable a user to modify various properties of a document . the modifications comprise building sentences from modification words , and combining them together in one display . the modifications are displayed in real time for a user to observe as they are inputted . the order of the modifications is managed by the user and is configured to be changed , added and / or removed ."
"reference is made to fig1 for illustrating a simplified block diagram of a currency conveyance or transport system 10 wherein an item of currency 12 is being conveyed past a particular point. a transport mechanism 14 can include driven rollers and the like for moving the item of currency 12 in the direction of the arrow. in accordance with this invention an optically - based currency thickness sensor is stationed at the particular point. the sensor includes at least one optical light source 16, which could be at least one laser source that generates at least one laser beam that is aimed so that the item of currency 12 passes through the beam. on the opposite side of the item of currency is at least one optical detector 18 having an output coupled to a processor 20. the processor 20 is capable of determining from the output of the detector 18 an amount of attenuation experienced by the laser beam as it passes through the item of currency. a physical and / or a logical counter 22 can be provided so as indicate a current count of items of currency 12 that pass through the laser beam. the teachings of this invention are not limited to the use of laser sources, such as frequency doubled yag lasers or semiconductor, solid state lasers, but could employ other light sources, such as a strobe light or, more preferably, one or more light emitting diodes ( leds ). referring now also to fig2 and 3, the relative amplitude of the detector 18 output signal can be seen to be a maximum before and after the passage of the item of currency 12 ( which is assumed in an exemplary, presently preferred high speed conveyance system to require about 15 milliseconds ). while the item of currency 12 is passing through the laser beam some portion of the beam is absorbed and, as a result, the output of detector 18 falls to a lower value. it can be seen readily seen that there is a significant and measurable difference between the amount of laser beam attenuation for the one note case, as opposed to the two note case ( fig2 and 3 ) and the three note case ( fig3 ). the processor 20 can be arranged to provide a status signal to the transport mechanism 14 for indicating, for example, when the output of the detector 18 indicates that more than one item of currency 12 is simultaneously present in the laser beam. the transport mechanism 14 may then stop the conveyor of the currency, or may operate a diverter for removing the multiple items of currency, or may perform any other suitable response to the indication that more than one item of currency is found to be simultaneously present in the laser beam. further in this regard, in a counting application, and if the output of the detector 18 has a magnitude that corresponds to the simultaneous presence of two items of currency 12 ( or three items of currency, etc. ), then the counter 22 can be incremented by the sensed number of items of currency, without stopping the transport mechanism 14 or operating a diverter. for example, of the counter 22 has a value of 78, and if the output of the detector 18 has a magnitude that corresponds to the simultaneous presence of two items of currency 12, then the counter 22 is incremented by two to become 80, and the operation of the transport mechanism 14 is not interrupted. the optical source 16 may be a commercially available diode laser ( or a led ) having an output wavelength in the range of about 400 nm to about one micrometer ( or longer ), and the detector 18 may be any suitable silicon - based or other type of detector that is responsive to the output light from the optical source 16. one presently preferred wavelength is about 670 nm. a wavelength of less than 400 nm may be too strongly absorbed to be of practical use, while a wavelength of significantly more than one micrometer may complicate the generation and / or detection of the optical signal. the optical source 16 may be operated in a continuous wave ( cw ) mode, or intermittently in a pulsed mode. the optically - based currency thickness sensor in accordance with the teaching of this invention may be used alone or in combination with other types of systems for detecting a presence of more than one item of currency. the optically - based currency thickness sensor in accordance with the teaching of this invention may be used to detect the length of, and the relative longitudinal orientations of, the items of currency as they pass the predetermined point. for example, if it is assumed that the laser beam will be attenuated for about 15 milliseconds by a normal sized item of currency having a particular orientation, when moving at the characteristic velocity of the conveyor mechanism, then any significant deviation from the 15 millisecond attenuation time, assuming that the velocity is within specifications, will be indicative of some problem with the length of or the orientation of the item of currency 12. this technique can thus also be used to detect the simultaneous presence of more than one item of currency, if it is assumed that the two or more items of currency are not exactly aligned edge to edge as they pass through region between the optical source ( s ) and the detector ( s ). in this case it can also be realized that the amount of attenuation of the light beam can be as much as 100 %, as it is the duration of the measured attenuation ( for example, some time greater than the time associated with one item of currency travelling at the nominal speed of the transport mechanism 14 ( e. g., 15 milliseconds ) ) that is of most significance, and not the actual amount of attenuation. it should be realized that the two techniques can be used together. for example, a detected decrease in the amount of transmitted light through an item of currency 12 is indicative of the simultaneous presence of two or more items of currency, and this condition can be verified by also determining if the duration of the attenuation exceeds the normal duration ( e. g., 15 milliseconds ). the opposite case can be employed as well, wherein a detected increase in the amount is employed to verify that a measured change in the duration of the attenuation was due to the presence of two or more items of currency, and was not due to detector noise or some fluctuation in the intensity of the optical source, etc. referring again to fig1 the system can further include another optical detector ( d ) 19 disposed for detecting light that reflects from the item of currency 12. in this case the processor 20 has another input coupled to an output of the optical detector 19 for determining at least one characteristic of the item of currency 12. the at least one characteristic can be an amount of soiling, as less light will be reflected from a soiled note than from a clean note. another characteristic could include the newness of the note, while another could include an amount of wrinkling of the note, while another could be related to whether the note is genuine or counterfeit. it is preferred that the output of the detector 19 be used in conjunction with the output of the detector 18, although either could be used alone. while described in the context of items of currency, it should be appreciated that the teachings of this invention can be applied as well to bank check handling machines and other types of equipment where relatively thin substrate materials are moved individually, or in groups, along a desired path. that is, while in the presently preferred embodiment of this invention a normal, desirable case is one item of currency 12, in other embodiments the normal case may be two items of some substrate material, and the undesirable cases may be the presence of only one item, or the presence of three or more items. referring again to fig3 it can be seen that the thickness sensor in accordance with this invention can readily discriminate between these cases. thus, while the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.","a method and system for detecting a presence of more than one item at a point along a conveyance path , comprising steps of generating a light beam and directing the beam through the path such that a presence of the item will cause the beam to be attenuated ; detecting the beam after it is attenuated by the presence of the item ; and determining from the amount of attenuation how many items are simultaneously present . in the preferred embodiment the item is an item of currency , and the step of generating a light beam includes a step of operating an optical source , such as an led or a laser , to generate a beam having a wavelength in the range of about 400 nm to about 1 micrometer or longer ."
"in fig4 an exemplary multicolor electrographic reproduction apparatus 10 is shown schematically. in the reproduction apparatus 10, a transport web 516 is driven and in turn drives the it & # 39 ; s ( 508 b, 508 c, 508 m, 508 y ) and imaging member pc & # 39 ; s ( 503 b, 503 c, 503 m, 503 y ). the imaging member pc & # 39 ; s are engaged with the it & # 39 ; s by flexible members 1 a, 1 b, 1 c and 1 d ( see fig1 - 3 ) according to this invention. the it & # 39 ; s ( 508 b, 508 c, 508 m, 508 y ) are constructed as shown in aforementioned rimai et al. and zaretsky et al. patents to be compliant, so that when engaged against the imaging members, the compliant layer or elastomer deforms creating a defined transfer nip. a variety of imaging defects, including color shifts and other registration errors, occur if the angular speed ( it ) of the it and the angular speed ( pc ) of the pc vary relative to each other when the image is transferred to the it or written to the pc. the relation of the angular speed between the pc and the it is called the speed ratio ( c ). the speed ratio ( c ) is defined through : c = pc it ( 1 ) in order to prevent image defects, it is therefore desirable to reduce and / or eliminate any changes in the speed ratio ( c ). the speed ratio equation can be expanded into the following equation : c = pc it = r it r pc ( 1 + s e ) ( 2 ) where r pc is the radius of the pc ( 503 ), r it is the radius of the undeformed it drum ( 508 ), e is an engagement factor representing the interference between the pc and it drums and s is a constant factor representing speed ratio sensitivity. this factor s is a function of the diameters of the pc and it and the thickness and the material properties of the it compliant blanket. the interference between the pc and it drums ( factor e ) is primarily determined by the pc and it runout. the runout is defined as the deviation of the radius of the pc, or the it, from the selected radius as a function of the angular position. the most common way, in the prior art, to mount an it and respective pc is with the axis of the drums mounted at a constant spacing. in such an arrangement, any change in runout will result in a change in interference and engagement, which can cause toner transfer artifacts. for the configuration of the reproduction apparatus 10 of fig4 the value for speed ratio sensitivity ( s ) is between 33 / m and 40 / m depending on the material and geometric properties ( thickness, for example ) of the it compliant blanket. if this speed ratio sensitivity ( s ) is smaller than 1 / r pc, the speed ratio c will increase with an increase of the pc drum radius due to runout. the speed ratio c will decrease if s is larger than 1 / r pc. in the specific case of the exemplary reproduction apparatus 10, the speed ratio sensitivity ( s ) is roughly three times larger than 1 / r pc. that means that the larger the pc radius is, the smaller the speed ratio c is. another known way of mounting an it and respective pc is to engage the it and the pc with constant force. that means that the pc and the it are engaged with a constant force and the distance between the centers of the two drums is constantly changing proportional to the changes in runout while the drums are rotating. in the constant force case, where the engagement between it and pc is constant, the speed ratio c is only a function of the two radii because the engagement is not changing ( see equation 2 above with e = constant ). in between the constant spacing and the constant force engagement it / pc mounting methods is the flexible engagement according to this invention. one of the two drum centers is fixed in space and the other one is engaged with a defined spring constant. the nominal engagement is achieved with a defined spring engagement 12 ( see fig1 ). the equation from above can be expanded to : c = pc it = r it r pc [ 1 + e [ s [ 1 ( 1 k f + 1 k s ) - 1 + 1 k bd ] - 1 k bd ] ] ( 3 ) where k f is the stiffness of a flexure spring ( 1 a, 1 b ) in z - direction, k bd is the stiffness ( in n / mm ) of the it blanket ( 13 ) engaged against the pc ( 503 ) and k s is the combined stiffness of all other parts in the it mount, in the z - direction, that add flexibility to the drum engagement. k bd is given by the blanket material properties and the drum geometry as well. k s is mainly given by the design of the respective shafts 4 and 5. in the ideal case, the speed ratio c is constant and the only parameter than can be changed freely is the stiffness k f of the flexure springs. the ideal case is given by the following equation : s [ 1 ( 1 k f + 1 k s ) - 1 + 1 k bd ] - 1 k bd = 1 r pc solving for k f : ( 4 ) k f = k s k bd ( s k s rpc - k bd - k s ) ( 5 ) for the configuration of the exemplary embodiment, the flexure stiffness has been determined to be a stiffness k f of 1360 n / mm - 1500 n / mm. when the stiffness of the flexure is adapted perfectly to the exemplary configuration, the errors in the speed ratio ( c ) can be reduced by 50 % - 90 %. the flexure is especially effective for the reduction of pc runout. the effects of pc runout on the speed ratio c can be reduced by 90 %. the higher the pc runout is, the more effective the flexure is in reducing the runout effect. the effects of the it runout on the speed ratio can be reduced by 40 - 60 %. overall, the engagement changes when using the flexure mount are smaller than the engagement changes in the constant spacing configuration, but larger than in the constant force case. in the preferred embodiment of the flexure spring according to this invention, the flexure spring is configured as a parallel spring. a parallel spring is the combination of two leaf springs ( see front flexure in fig1 and 2, items 1 a and 1 b, and rear flexure in fig3 items 1 c and 1 d ). the ends of the leaf springs 1 a, 1 b on the right side are rigidly connected by the parts 7 and 8 a, 8 b, and the ends on the left are rigidly connected by the parts 9 a, 9 b and 11. the parts 1 a, 1 b, 7, 8 a, 8 b, 9 a, 9 b and 11 form a rectangular frame with two rigid sides ( parts 7 and 11 ) and two flexible sides ( leaf springs 1 a, 1 b ). the two rigid sides can only move parallel to each other. since one end of this frame ( part 11 ) is mounted in a fixed location, the other side ( part 7 ) has only one degree of freedom left. part 7 can only move up and down, in the z direction, controlled by the stiffness of the flexures ( leaf springs 1 a, 1 b ). there are two parallel spring assemblies, one in the front and one in the back of the reproduction apparatus 10, each supporting one end of the it shaft 5. the it shaft 5 is supported in the bearings 6, which are in turn supported in the parts 7 a, 7 b, respectively in the front and back of the reproduction apparatus 10. as an alternative assembly, it can, of course, in certain circumstances be advantageous to reverse the setup and mount the it in a fixed manner, and to provide a similar flexible mount for the pc. fig2 and 3 respectively show the integration of the leaf springs 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c, 1 d into an it mount. the parts 11 a, 11 b and 11 c, 11 d are respectively mounted, in any suitable manner, to the frame of the reproduction apparatus ( shown in fig4 ), and as such have a fixed location during operation. a safety gap ( designated by numerals 14 a, 14 b, respectively in fig2 and 3 ) is provided between the parts 7 a and 8 b, and between the parts 7 b and 8 c respectively. the safety gap is determined to provide only a maximum allowable deflection of the springs 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c, 1 d, in the z direction. at any larger deflection of the leaf springs, the parts 7 a and 11 b, and the parts 7 b and 11 e come into physical contact and prevent the flexures from further deformation. similarly, in the + z direction the parts 11 b and 11 e are respectively engaged by parts 8 a and 8 d to prevent significant deformation of the flexures. the front flexures 1 a, 1 b, and the rear flexures 1 c, and 1 d are preferably made out of spring steel, but other materials such as, for example, aluminum or brass as well as glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastic can be used. for the parts 7 a, 7 b, 11 a, 11 b, 11 c, and 11 e, cast iron, aluminum as well as glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastic can, for example, be used. the dimensions of the flexure springs in the preferred embodiment are selected to be 55 mm by 21. 6 mm by 2. 5 mm ( flexing length, between parts 9 a, 9 b and between parts 9 c, 9 d, respectively, by width by thickness ). of course, these selected dimensions can vary greatly, depending on the spring material and the space available. in general the length can vary from 10 mm - 150 mm, the width from 3 mm - 50 mm and the thickness from 0. 1 mm - 8 mm. as discussed above, fig4 shows an exemplary image forming reproduction apparatus designated generally by the numeral 10 the reproduction apparatus 10 is in the form of an electrophotographic reproduction apparatus, and more particularly a color reproduction apparatus wherein color separation images are individually formed in each of four colors. the color separation images are transferred in register to a receiver member as such receiver member is moved through the apparatus while supported on a transport web 516. the exemplary apparatus features four substantially similar color modules ( 591 b, 591 c, 591 m, 591 y ). each of the four color modules ( 591 b, 591 c, 591 m, 591 y ) is of similar construction except that, as shown, one transport belt 516 operates with all the modules, a receiver member being transported by the belt 516 from module to module and each module having a different color image developer associated therewith. the elements in fig4 that are similar from module to module have similar reference numbers with a suffix of b, c, m, and y, referring to the color module to which it is associated. four receiver members or sheets 512 a, 512 b, 512 c, and 512 d are shown simultaneously receiving images from the different modules, it being understood, as noted above, that each receiver member may receive one color image from each module, and that up to four color images can be received by each receiver member. the movement of the receiver member with the belt 516 is such that each color image transferred to the receiver member at the transfer nip of each module must be transferred so as to be registered with the previous color transfer so that a four - color image formed on the receiver member has the colors in registered superposed relationship on the receiver member. the receiver members are then sent seriatim to a fusing station ( not shown ) to fuse or fix the dry toner images to the respective receiver members. the belt is reconditioned by providing charge to both surfaces using, for example, opposed corona chargers 522, 523, which neutralize charge on the surfaces of the belt. each color module includes a primary image forming member, for example a drum 503 b, 503 c, 503 m, and 503 y, respectively. each drum 503 b, 503 c, 503 m, and 503 y has a photoconductive surface, upon which a pigmented marking particle image ( or alternatively, a series of different color marking particle images ) is formed. in order to form images, the outer surface of the drum is uniformly charged by a primary charger such as a corona charging device 505 b, 505 c, 505 m, and 505 y, respectively, or other suitable charger such as roller chargers, brush chargers, etc. the uniformly charged surface is exposed by suitable exposure device, such as, for example, an led exposure device 506 b, 506 c, 506 m, and 506 y, respectively, or a laser or other electro - optical exposure device, or even an optical exposure device. the exposure device selectively alters the charge on the photoconductive surface of the drum to create an electrostatic image corresponding to an image to be reproduced. the electrostatic image is developed by application of pigmented marking particles to the latent image bearing a photoconductive drum by a development station 581 b, 581 c, 581 m, and 581 y, respectively. the development station is a particular color of pigmented toner marking particles associated respectively therewith. thus, the modules create a series of different color marking particle images ( color separation images ) on the respective photoconductive drums. each marking particle image is transferred to an outer surface of a respective secondary ( or intermediate transfer ) member, for example, an intermediate transfer roller ( itr ) 508 b, 508 c, 508 m, and 508 y, respectively. after transfer, residual marking particles and dust are cleaned from the surface of the photoconductive drum by a suitable cleaning device 504 b, 504 c, 504 m, and 504 y, respectively, to prepare the surface for reuse for forming subsequent toner images. a single color - marking particle image, respectively formed on the outer surface of the intermediate transfer member drum ( one identified as numeral 542 b in fig4 and the others not identified ), is transferred to a receiver member, is fed sequentially into a nip between the intermediate image transfer member drums and a transfer backing roller 521 b, 521 c, 521 m, and 521 y, respectively. the transfer backing rollers are suitably electrically biased by power supply 552 to induce the charged toner particle image to transfer to the receiver member. the receiver member is fed from a suitable receiver member supply ( not shown ) and moves serially into each of the nips 510 b, 510 c, 510 m, and 510 y where it receives the respective marking particle image. the receiver member exits the last nip and is transported by a suitable transport mechanism ( not shown ) to a fuser ( not shown ) where the marking particle image is fixed to the receiver member by application of heat and / or pressure. a detack charger 524 may be provided to deposit a neutralizing charge on the receiver member to facilitate separation of the receiver member from the belt 516. the receiver member with the fixed marking particle image is thereafter transported to a remote location for operator retrieval. the itr is cleaned by a cleaning device 511 b, c, m and y to prepare it for reuse. in view of the above description, it is readily apparent that, with the use of the invention of the flexible mounts for the compliant intermediate transfer member, in the preferred embodiment, there is a significant reduction in engagement sensitivity of speed ratio to runout of the photoconductor drum and the associated intermediate transfer drum. this is desired for accurate color registration of the individual color separation images one on another to form an accurate reproduction, which is substantially defect free. further, the engagement variation is greatly reduced compared to the described constant spacing configuration. this leads to a more constant nip width, which is important for a constant image quality at the image transfer from the photoconductor drum to the associated intermediate transfer drum. the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.","in a reproduction apparatus having a rotatable imaging roller upon which an image is formed , and a rotatable transfer roller for transferring an image from the imaging roller to a receiver member , a device for mounting the transfer roller to substantially compensate for changes in engagement between the imaging roller and the transfer roller during image transfer . the mounting device includes a bearing assembly for supporting the transfer roller for rotation . a flexible member is associated with the bearing assembly . the flexible member provides movement of the bearing assembly by urging the bearing assembly in a direction to maintain , at least over a limited distance , the transfer roller in constant force engagement with the imaging roller so as to substantially prevent any change in the angular speed relationship therebetween ."
"illustrated in fig1 is a simplified analytical prober which includes a heavy stable base 10 which supports on side pedestals 11 a vertically movable u - shaped platen 12. positioned on the surface of the base and below the open front of the u - shaped platen is a roll - out stage 14 having controls for fine adjustments in x, y and z directions. secured to the surface of the stage 14 is a vacuum chuck 16 and a microscope 18 is centered over the chuck. during normal operation in which temperatures are of no particular concern, a silicon wafer having a typical thickness of 250 to 600 microns and which may contain a hundred or more individual integrated circuits is secured directly to the surface of the vacuum chuck 16 and the stage 14 is adjusted to observe one of the integrated circuits in the microscope field of view. if only a few circuits are to be tested, or if the test involves contacting only two or three of the very fine conductors on the circuit then movable probe positioners, each with one probe tip, are secured by vacuum on the flat surface of the platen 12 and their probe tips are carefully adjusted to contact the desired circuit conductors. if, on the other hand, many identical devices are to be tested then a probe care 20 is inserted into an adapter secured in the open front portion of the u - shaped platen. the probe card is a typical & # 34 ; plug - in & # 34 ; circuit card with a central hole into which extend probe tips 22 corresponding in number to the number and also the location of device conductors to be contacted. thus, to perform a test on a circuit, the circuit is accurately positioned under the hole in the probe card and the stage 14 is raised by its z adjustment until contact is made with the probe tips. the probe tips 22 are coupled through the probe circuit card to appropriate associated test circuitry which performs the required test on the device. as previously mentioned, the vacuum chuck 16 may be heated for the electrical testing of devices on wafers directly coupled to the chuck, but the application of chilled fluids for cold testing results in atmospheric dew and even frost on the wafer to the detriment of the ic devices. furthermore, a considerable amount of time is required to heat an ic device on a wafer to a desired test temperature because of heat losses due to the mass of the chuck 14, the heat conductivity between chuck and metal stage 14, and also the need to heat the thin wafer material. in the system now to be described, the ic device directly receives the temperature controling medium at the desired extreme testing temperature and is nearly instantly brought up or down to that temperature. as illustrated in the simplified elevational view of fig1 a wafer 24 having thereon a device 26 to be tested is positioned on the surface of a heat insulating pad 29 which is positioned on the surface of the chuck 16. temperature changes made to the device 26 and its wafer 24 cannot, therefore, be affected by the masses of the chuck 16 or stage 14. the device 26 is aligned on the optical axis of the microscope 18 and is centered in the hole in the probe card 20 so that the various probes 22 on the card will contact the conductors on the device when the stage 14 is raised. positioned on the top surface of the probe card 20 is a toroidal nozzle 28 having a central hole coaxially aligned on the optical axis of the microscope 18. the nozzle is formed with two annular vents that open into the central hole. a first vent 30 is directed downward through the nozzle central hole and is coupled through a perforated baffle ring 32 to an annular plenum 34 as best shown in the sectional view of fig3. the plenum is coupled through a temperature controllable heater 36 to a source of liquid nitrogen or other extremely cold, dry, inert gas. the second annular vent 38 in the nozzle overlies the vent 30 ; it is physically shorter than the first nozzle 30 and is coupled to an annular chamber 40 which surrounds the top and exterior surface of the plenum 34 and which receives dry nitrogen after it has been heated to approximately room temperature or slightly higher. thus, the warm dry gas within the chamber 40 prevents exterior surface chilling of the nozzle and possible atmospheric dew from forming and the small amount of warm dry gas emitted through its vent 38 will drift upward to prevent possible fogging of the microscope 18. the gas heater 36 receives nitrogen gas from an associated liquid nitrogen tank at its dew point of - 220 c. and heats a small portion to near room temperature for the chamber 40 and second vent 38. the heater 36 must also heat a supply of gas to the temperature necessary for the testing of a device. this testing temperature is controlled by external controls which are not part of the invention and the selected temperature of the gas emitted through the first vent 30 is monitored by a sensor 42 located in that vent. a second temperature sensor 44, placed in the surface of the thermal insulator pad 28, is used during calibration so that an associated microprocessor can control the gas temperature and flow rate through the nozzle to ensure accurate temperatures of the device 26 under test. in use, the temperature regulated gas emitted from the plenum 34 and first vent 30 falls in the form of a tubular curtain to the surface of the wafer 24 and spreads over the probe tips, previously at room temperature and which could perform as heat sinks, and the ic devices on the wafer to rapidly change their temperatures to that of the gas. to prevent the intrusion of moisture laden atmospheric air, the base area of the prober instrument is substantially sealed with a surrounding baffle structure 46 or similar structure so that the dry gas introduced through the nozzle 28 and flowing down over the wafer will purge all moisture laden room air from the apparatus in the areas below the gas emitting nozzle 28. thus, during cold testing, the system is self - correcting in that no frost can form on a wafer if it is warm due to the lack of the cold dry gas, nor will frost form when it is cold because only the dry gas can chill the wafer.","a prober for the electrical testing of unpackaged integrated circuits on a semiconductor wafer can test these devices between subfreezing to elevated temperatures without generating atmospheric fog or frost on the wafer or associated equipment by directing an enclosed tubular curtain of dry gas , such as heated liquid nitrogen , down from a circular nozzle above the wafer to encircle the device under test . observations can be made and electrical tests performed within the curtain while all moist atmospheric air is purged from the wafer and surrounding areas so that fog and frost cannot form ."

surgery x ). presently, there is a push in the medical care industry to switch from pay per procedure to pay per bundle by an insurance carrier. the care giver is paid a fixed price for services to be rendered as a bundle rather than individually, i. e., the care giver is paid once. examples of such treatment include treating for congestive heart failure ( chf ) ( heart attack ) including in hospital and home care post procedure. in the pay per bundle, a care provider can increase profit and reduce risk by ( 1 ) avoiding duplication of procedures by various specialists needed for treatment and ( 2 ) by verifying that post - procedure protocols that reduce complications are followed in the hospital and at home. for example, for a chf patient weight change within 60 days of a heart attack can indicate problems. in another example, when a bulimic or anorexic patient induces vomiting, his heart stops this can be seen by a blood pressure sensor. in another example, a patient & # 39 ; s insulin levels retrieved from the glucose monitor can indicate when an insulin shot was received by a diabetic patient. fig1 is an embodiment of a system 100 used by medical facilities. at

case or workflow 700 usable for monitoring post - procedure monitoring of patients who have suffered from congestive heart failure. use case 700 can be used for remote monitoring of discharged patients. when, a patient is discharged from hospital after a congestive heart failure treatment, the patient needs to be monitored real time. using data 702 obtained from multiple healthcare related systems like emr 704, ehr 706 or ban sensors 708 and applying business rules 710, use case 700 can generate actionable events 720 for the treatment of the patient. in some embodiments, by applying business rules 710, data from emr 704, ehr 706 or ban sensors 708 can be collated. in some embodiments, ban sensors 708 can comprise body area networked devices. ban sensors 708 can monitor the patient while he is stationary for example, at home or when the patient has restricted mobility. business rules 710 can monitor equipment and services and can generate events 720. events 720 can be to alert caregiver 722. the alert can raise alarms / notifications to the caregiver if something goes wrong, as defined by business rules 710. additionally, business rules 710 can update ehr 726 with the progress of the patient. for example, the rule structure can comprise : fig8 shows an embodiment, where a system 800 can be used to create and score individuals profile using data obtained from an individual ehr. the information can include public and restricted personal profiles. for example, data source 802 can comprise a patient intake system. when a new ehr 806, for example, a veteran & # 39 ; s record, is received into the ehr system, the system can invoke business rule 810. business rule 810 can retrieve a profile 804 and ehr 806. in some embodiments, profile data 804 may not exist in the healthcare data domain. in such events, profile data 804 can be collected by business rule 810 from government sources ( e. g., military records, ncic database ), or from private sources ( e. g., credit reports, employment records ), or from other public sources ( e. g., facebook, linkedin ) to generate one or more profiles. this data can be collated. per the rule engine 810, the patient & # 39 ; s mental health is then assessed by the system or by a health care provider and a score is generated. if deemed medically necessary by the system and / or health care provider, events 820 can be generated. events 820 can alert caregiver 822 to contact the patient. in some embodiments, alert caregiver 822 can contact the patient through the web for a mental health assessment built for suicide prevention. the resulting scores of the assessment packet from business rule 810 can then be entered into the ehr system for clinicians review. for example, the rule structure can comprise : fig9 an embodiment of a data flow diagram for a use case or workflow 900 to validate compliance against configurable protocols and care workflows. using data 902 obtained from multiple healthcare related systems like his 903, ehr 904, emr 906 or ban sensors 908 and applying business rules 910, use case 900 can generate actionable events 920 for the treatment of the patient. in some embodiments, by applying business rules 910, data from his 903, ehr 904, emr 906 or ban sensors 908 can be collated. business rules 910 in the target hospital can monitor activity of his 912 within the hospital. business rules 910 can then compare the activity with patient data 914 and watch for exceptions 916. in this manner, business rules can evaluate whether a protocol is being violated. for example, if a patient is undergoing certain operative procedure, business rules 910 can check if the expected set of medications is dispatched from inventory. another example would be to monitor certain never events and prevent them from occurring. business rules 910 can monitor equipment and services and can generate events 920. events 920 can be to alert caregiver 922. the alert can raise alarms / notifications to the caregiver if something goes wrong, as defined by business rules 910. additionally, business rules 910 can update ehr 924 with the progress of the patient. for example, the rule structure can comprise : vista is a historical ehr / emr system being used by certain u. s. hospitals for a long time. the system is adapted and customized by certain government agencies such as va and department of defense ( dod ) for storing medical records of individuals. the system is not so open for third party developers outside of va and dod, and currently there is a lack of publicly available tools to integrate with vista. current challenges can be summarized as : tools available to integrate with vista provide high level support for hl7 or rpc calls. however there is no specific support to perform certain system functions. vista implementations may differ across locations of va hospitals and there is no publicly available common api to provide integration. vista accepts cprs as its client software. cprs talks with vista using rpc calls these rpc calls are very specific and may differ across locations / vista installations. there is not a publicly available authorized list of rpc calls for outside integrators. an integration package can be trained with an instance of vista server and the trained system can later be utilized for performing specific integration tasks. the integration package has following parts : a recorder module which listens and records rpc traffic between cprs and vista in a log file a player module which replays the traffic recorded in log file in earlier step an object based substitution engine written in java which substitutes key data elements of the rpc calls being replayed thus allowing external software to repetitively replay log files with different data elements to perform the job frequently without involving manual usage of cprs. the use case or workflow which needs to be automated for integration can be identified. examples of a workflow or use case include : a. add / view a patient record b. add / view a clinical note for a patient c. add clinical reminder into clinical note for given patient, such as, audit - c, phq - 9, tbi, mst, tobacco, pc _ ptsd d. retrieve list of registered patients to check if a patient already has a record in vista e. digitally sign or not sign a newly created / existing note. document in the clinical note a need for placing a consult to other departments. the system can perform the use case or workflow through cprs and record the rpc calls into a log file. then the player code is changed to set values to be substituted in the rpc calls being replaced. finally, the system replays the log files with different values to perform the same use case in a black box mode. for adding a clinical reminder into an existing patient record in vista. the emr records maintained within vista are not publicly accessible. information provided by va on the rpc calls is described, for example, at : http : / / www. va. gov / vdl / documents / infrastructure / remote _ proc _ call _ broker _ ( rpc ) / xwb1 1p47r elease _ notes. doc. the following rpc commands will be updated real time using value substitution as described : following are the assumed interpretations of the data source to be consumed by the system described. an emr comprises medical information of a person stored at unit level caregiver, mostly about current instance of care. an ehr comprises medical and health related information of a personal stored at global level of the caregiver, mostly about historical records. a personal health record ( phr ) comprises health records in possession of an, individual. a body area network ( ban ) comprises data about vital signs collected from devices worn on or in proximity of body. a his can comprise software systems running in a hospital, including but not limited to, patient intake, operations room mgmt, erp, inventory, billing, etc. in some embodiments, personal profiles are publicly available and legally obtainable. in some embodiments, private profile data comprises profiles including but not limited to social network profiles, financial data, driving records, legal records. in some embodiments, dynamic dimensional data is not restricted to a business of medical function or use case. this is a homogeneous form of data obtained from heterogeneous data sources. actionable events comprise events, alerts and notifications generated by the system when the data qualifies configurable business rules. business rules comprise business function / domain / use case specific rules which are user configured, and the system needs to apply on available data. the ehr server software used and maintained by certain u. s. government agencies including va and dod is named vista. cprs is the ehr client software used and maintained by certain u. s. government agencies including va and dod. rpc is the tcp / ip based non - public interface cprs uses to talk with vista. the various embodiments described above are provided by way of illustration only and should not be constructed to limit the invention. those skilled in the art will readily recognize the various modifications and changes which may be made to the present invention without strictly following the exemplary embodiments illustrated and

"while the present invention is described with respect to the preferred embodiments described below and shown in the figures, the present invention is limited only by the metes and bounds of the claims that follow. the apparatus and methods described herein enable the creation of a color digital image of preferably full resolution using a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100. the benefits of the apparatus include a reduced unit manufacturing cost when compared to the equivalent process using a full color digital camera or sensor and no reduction in image quality due to the use of a color filter array to produce a color image. another important benefit is the use of a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 allows for a shorter and more compact optical path suitable for confined spaces. for a general understanding of the disclosed technology, reference is made to the drawings. in the drawings, like reference numerals have been used to designate identical elements. in describing the disclosed technology, the following term ( s ) have been used in the description. the term image or picture refers to a two - dimensional light intensity function optionally having x - axis and y - axis position coordinates with a numerical value that is proportional to the brightness or gray level of the image at the specified coordinate point. the term analog or analogue refers a picture or image that is continuous both spatially in two - dimensions and in brightness or intensity. the term digital refers a picture or image that is digitized to a predefined number of levels both spatially in two - dimensions and in brightness or intensity. a digital image may be represented by a vector or matrix whose row and column indices identify a point in the image and the corresponding vector or matrix numerical value identifies the brightness or intensity at that point. the term intensity refers to the amount of light reaching a digital camera or sensor such that the higher the relative output value the greater the number of photons reaching the digital camera or sensor. intensity is commonly associated with digital pictures or images. the term density refers to the amount of light reaching a digital camera or sensor such that the higher the relative output value the fewer the number of photons reaching the digital camera or sensor. density is commonly associated with photographic pictures or images. the term reflection intensity refers to the amount of light received by a digital camera or sensor where the light path originates at a source and reverberates or bounces or is reflected off an object of interest, subsequently arriving at the digital camera or sensor. the term transmission intensity refers to the amount of light received by a digital camera or sensor where the light path originates at a source and proceeds through an object of interest, subsequently arriving at the digital camera or sensor. the term contrast refers to the difference in the color and brightness of the object and other objects within the same field of view. the maximum contrast of an image is the contrast ratio or dynamic range. the term dynamic range or equivalently contrast ratio refers to the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color ( white ) to that of the darkest color ( black ) that the system is capable of producing. the term luminance refers to a photometric measure of the intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction. it describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. the term red refers the color perceived by humans corresponding to the longer wavelengths of visible light, generally in the wavelength range of substantially 630 - 740 nanometers. the term green refers the color perceived by humans corresponding to visible light having a spectrum dominated by energy generally with a wavelength of substantially 520 - 570 nanometers. the term blue refers the color perceived by humans corresponding to the shorter wavelengths of visible light, generally in the wavelength range of substantially 440 - 490 nanometers. the term monochrome refers to images in one color or shades or tones of one color. a black - and - white image, composed of shades of gray, is an example of a monochrome image. the term gray - scale refers to a digital image in which the value of each pixel is a single sample, that is, it carries only intensity information. images of this sort, for example, black - and - white, are composed exclusively of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest intensity. the term plane or color plane refers to a set of intensities or densities associated with a single color which may be the result of a reflection process, transmission process, or a combination of both. the term pixel refers to a discrete spatial component of a digital picture or image and is short for picture element. the term full resolution refers to a monochrome or color digital image having maximum information content associated a specified number of pixels where, for example, a rectangular digital image the total number of pixels is the number of rows of pixels multiplied by the number of columns of pixels. the term reduced resolution refers to a monochrome or color digital image where the information content has been reduced by the application of a mathematical algorithm to the raw pixel data, such as interpolation or low pass filtering, which has been used to generate output pixel values. while the number of pixels in the reduced resolution digital image may be spatially the same as a full resolution digital image, that is the spatial size of the two digital images are the same, the information content of the reduced resolution digital image is significantly lower. the term spatial resolution refers to the physical size or dimensions of a digital image. for a rectangular digital image, the spatial resolution is the number of pixels in a row by the number of pixels in a column. the common unit of resolution for digital cameras or sensor is megapixels. the term suitably capture or suitably captured refers to methods that enable obtaining high quality imagery of diagnostic cassettes or objects of interest. the term depth of field refers to the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on each side of the focused distance, so that within the depth of field, the amount of unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing or imaging conditions. all objects within the depth of field of an imaging or optical system are considered to be in focus. the term hadamard multiplication refers to a type of matrix multiplication where the matrices being multiplied have the same number of rows and columns, as does the resultant or output matrix, and the elements of the resultant or output matrix, for a specific row and column, are formed by the multiplication of the values of the elements having the same specific row and column. this is also known as element - by - element matrix multiplication. the term duty cycle refers to the time that an entity spends in an active state as a fraction of the total time under consideration. for a light emitting diode ( led ), the duty cycle would be the fraction of the time that the led has actually been emitting light since a predetermined starting time. the amount of time that an led has actually been emitting light is the numerical value of the duty cycle ( a number between 0. 0 and 1. 0 ) times the time elapsed since the predetermined starting time. the term diagnostic cassette refers to test elements that are commonly defined by a flat planar substrate having a plurality of transparent microtubes or microcolumns that define test chambers. a predetermined quantity of inert bead or gel material is added to each of the microtubes. this inert material may be coated with an antibody or an antigen or provided with a carrier - bound antibody or antigen or with specific reagents. typically, a foil wrap is used to cover the top of the card or cassette, thereby sealing the contents of each microcolumn until the time of test. the foil wrap is pierceable or otherwise removed to enable aliquots of patient sample and / or reagents to be added to each of the microtubes, either manually or in an automated apparatus. the term diagnostic analyzer or diagnostic clinical analyzer refers to a semi - automated or automated apparatus composed of various subsystems including a patient sample handler, a test vessel ( such as a diagnostic cassette ) handler, an incubator, a centrifuge, a pipette for obtaining and dispensing reagents and patient samples, and a means to measure and quantify the result of specific tests on the patient sample among others. one aspect of the invention is directed to a method and apparatus for producing color digital images at full resolution using a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100. a primary benefit of the technology is reduced unit manufacturing cost in comparison to the use of a color digital camera or sensor, producing equivalent digital resolution, when employed as a component of a diagnostic clinical analyzer. another benefit is that the resulting color image quality produced by this method using the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 is of higher quality than an image produced by a color digital camera or sensor, of equivalent spatial resolution, employing a color filter array because of the loss of effective resolution ( resulting in reduced resolution ) due to the image sensor data manipulation required in the latter case. color filter arrays are described by bryce e. bayer in u. s. pat. no. 3, 971, 065 entitled color imaging array which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. yet another benefit is that the smaller physical size of the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100, as compared to the size of a color digital camera or sensor of equivalent resolution, results in a shorter optical path more suitable for confined spaces. the process of producing a diagnostic result generally requires the transport of the diagnostic cassette to accept the patient sample and diagnostic reagents plus potential movement to a region of higher temperature ( incubation ) or to an apparatus to apply centrifugal force. at the end of the incubation and centrifugation processes, the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 can be held in one or more fixed positions. at that point, sequential illumination can be employed to obtain a full resolution color digital image of the front and of the back of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 and its contents. fig1 is a simplified schematic diagram of the sequential color imaging apparatus. conceptually, a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 receives light, at any specific instance in time, of only one color from at least one front illumination light source, preferably tri - color light emitting diodes ( leds ) 101, which can selectively emit red, green, or blue light and from at least one rear illumination source, preferably tri - color light emitting diodes ( leds ) 103, which can selectively emit red, green, or blue light. the illumination sequence of the tri - color leds is coordinated such that sequential monochrome exposures composed of only red, green, or blue light are produced. the mechanical holder 104 in fig1 holds the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 while the sequential illumination and image capture for the front - side of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 is in process. as the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 has two sides, the mechanical holder 104 is capable of rotating 180 so that the back - side of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 can be imaged. as a result of the sequential illumination and image capture for the front - side of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 and the sequential illumination and image capture for the back - side of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102, six images or image planes are produced, specifically : 1. a monochrome red image of the front of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. 2. a monochrome green image of the front of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. 3. a monochrome blue image of the front of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. 4. a monochrome red image of the back of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. 5. a monochrome green image of the back of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. 6. a monochrome blue image of the back of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. further details of a preferred mechanical holder 104 can be found in the commonly assigned co - pending application of robert jones and lynn willett entitled an apparatus for gripping and holding diagnostic cassettes ( ser. no. 61 / 545, 651 ), filed oct. 11, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. fig2 is a schematic diagram depicting the qualitative aspects of the sequential exposure and imaging process. at time 1, a combination red light source 200, from both the front illumination led 101 and the rear illumination led 102, is used to illuminate a color object 203 consisting of red, green, blue, black, and white patches. by definition, a patch exhibiting the color red is one which absorbs all wavelengths of light except red. similarly, a green patch absorbs all wavelengths of light except green and a blue patch absorbs all wavelengths of light except blue. a black patch absorbs all wavelengths of light and reflects none whereas a white patch absorbs no wavelengths of light and reflects all. hence, qualitatively, the resulting combination of reflectance and transmittance intensities 204 ( represented here by a vector of five qualitative values ) for red illumination 200 of the color object 203 results in a high intensity for the red patch, low intensity for the green patch, low intensity for the blue patch, low intensity for the black patch, and high intensity for the white patch. at time 2, a green light source 201, from both the front illumination led 101 and the rear illumination led 102, is used to illuminate the color object 203. qualitatively, the resulting combination of reflectance and transmittance intensities 205 ( represented here by a vector of five qualitative values ) for green illumination 201 of the color object 203 results in a low intensity for the red patch, high intensity for the green patch, low intensity for the blue patch, low intensity for the black patch, and high intensity for the white patch. at time 3, a blue light source 202, from both the front illumination led 101 and the rear illumination led 102, is used to illuminate the color object 203. qualitatively, the resulting combination of reflectance and transmittance intensities 206 ( represented here by a vector of five qualitative values ) for blue illumination 102 of the color palette 103 results in a low intensity for the red patch, low intensity for the green patch, high intensity for the blue patch, low intensity for the black patch, and high intensity for the white patch. each set of these resulting intensities can be thought of as a color plane of intensities based upon red, green, and blue illumination, respectively. fig3 is a diagram of the color image reconstruction process using the color planes resulting from the illumination operations as described in fig2 above. the intensity resulting from a specific patch ( or equivalently, a specific pixel ) in the red color plane 204 is combined with intensities for the same patch ( or equivalently, the same specific pixel ) in the green color plane 205 and the blue color plane 206. using qualitative measures of high and low, for the first patch in the color planes ( denoted element 1, 1 ), the resulting color of the patch in the color image 300 requires the combination of high red, low green, and low blue intensities resulting in a red patch in the color image 300. in a similar fashion, for the second patch in the color planes, ( denoted element 2, 1 ), the resulting color of the patch in the color image 300 requires the combination of low red, high green, and low blue resulting in a green patch in the color image 300. likewise, for the third patch in the color planes, ( denoted element 3, 1 ), the resulting color of the patch in the color image 300 requires the combination of low red, low green, and high blue resulting in a blue patch in the color image 300. for the fourth patch in the color planes, ( denoted element 4, 1 ), the resulting color of the patch in the color image 300 requires the combination of low red, low green, and low blue resulting in a black patch in the color image 300. and for the fifth patch in the color planes, ( denoted element 5, 1 ), the resulting color of the patch in the color image 300 requires the combination of high red, high green, and high blue resulting in a white patch in the color image 300. fig4 is a diagram of the field of view 400 of the digital camera or sensor 100 showing the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102, upright 407 and inverted 408 resolution targets, and gray - scale test patches ( 401, 402, 403, 404, and 405 ). the upright 407 and inverted 408 resolution targets and the gray - scale test patches ( 401, 402, 403, 404, and 405 ) are presented on a clear plastic pane in the background of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. there are two groups of gray - scale patches, one on each side of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. on the left hand side, from top to bottom, there is gray - scale patch of 100 % transmission intensity 401, 85 % transmission intensity 402, 70 % transmission intensity 403, 55 % transmission intensity 404, and 40 % transmission intensity 405. on the right hand side, from top to bottom, there is gray - scale patch of 40 % transmission intensity 405, 55 % transmission intensity 404, 70 % transmission intensity 403, 85 % transmission intensity 402, and 100 % transmission intensity 401. these gray - scale patches are used to calibrate the images and establish an appropriate white / color balance. the upright 407 and inverted 408 resolution targets are used to make sure that the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 is in focus. both the upright 407 and inverted 408 resolution targets and the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 are positioned such that they are included within the depth of field of the imaging system. note that there are a number of microcolumns 409, containing gel or glass bead microparticles, which is where the solutions to be analyzed are placed. fig5 is a graph 500 of exemplary spectrums of blue light 501, green light 502, and red light 503 as emitted by tri - color leds. the peak value of relative intensity of each exemplary light spectrum has been normalized to unity for this graph. fig6 is a more detailed schematic plan diagram of the imaging system shown in fig1. the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 is shown behind a cylindrical reflector 601 which directs the light emitted from the set of tri - color light emitting diode circuit boards 602 mounted on the far right edges of the cylindrical reflector 601 onto the front of diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. the rear illuminating light emitting diode circuit board 603 illuminates the rear of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 directly. the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 images the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102 through an opening 604 in the cylindrical reflector 601. the light reaching the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 is a combination of light emitted by the set of front illumination light emitting diode circuit boards 602 and the rear illumination light emitting diode circuit board 603. the cylindrical reflector 601 directs the light being emitted by the set of front illumination light emitting diode circuit boards 602 towards the front of the diagnostic cassette or object of interest 102. this illumination along with illumination from the rear illumination light emitting diode circuit board 603 provides uniform illumination intensity. fig7 is a schematic diagram of one of the set of two front illumination light emitting diode circuit boards 602. the circuit board 602 has a vertical to horizontal aspect ratio of substantially between 3 to 1 and 10 to 1. the tri - color light emitting diodes 701 are distributed vertically. while four tri - color light emitting diodes, arranged in a vertical pattern, are shown in fig7, configurations having from substantially 2 to 12 vertically aligned light emitting diodes are possible. fig8 is a schematic diagram of the back illumination light emitting diode circuit board 603. the circuit board 603 is substantially rectangular in shape with tri - color light emitting diodes 701 configured in a substantially rectangular pattern or array. the circuit board 603 shown in fig8 has 16 tri - color light emitting diodes 701 configured in a substantially rectangular array ; however, different patterns or arrays of tri - color light emitting diodes 701 is possible including having different numbers of diodes 701 in either the horizontal ( row ) or vertical ( column ) orientations. additionally, it is possible to have a smaller number or a larger number overall of diodes 701, substantially in the range of 9 to 144. fig9 is a listing of an example matlab m - file used to calibrate, process, and produce the final front illumination and back illumination full color images obtained from the red, green, and blue monochrome sequential exposures. the output from the gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100, in bit map format, is read into matlab from an image storage area on file f : in statements 901. note that there are red, green, and blue monochrome planes for each front illumination exposure and for each back illumination exposure. the size of each digital image, both front illumination and back illumination, is determined in statements 902. statements 903 secure space to store the output of the computations and initialize all elements of that space to zeros. the scalar weights for each color plane are defined in statement 904. statements 905 apply the appropriate scalar weight to element in the six image planes, respectively. a maximum intensity value for the front illumination plane and a maximum intensity value for the back illumination plane are found in statements 906. these maximum intensity values are then used to scale the final front illumination image and the back illumination image in statement 907. note that a correction or calibration weight matrix has been employed in this computation. the above apparatus is appropriately configured to allow for a calibration and image processing method capable of coping with a number of environmental and equipment - related issues. these issues are most conveniently organized into four tiers as follows : variations in gray - scale digital camera or sensor sensitivity including illumination variability a tier 1 calibration of the imaging subsystem takes place shortly after manufacture in the factory. electrical component variability is addressed via the use of mechanically modifiable resistors ( for example, a potentiometer which is a three - terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider ) and instrumentation such that a sequence of predefined test signals results in a sequence of predefined test results. variations in gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 sensitivity including illumination variability are addressed via the determination of a matrix of multiplicative weights. this matrix of multiplicative weights has the same row and column dimensions as the output matrix of pixels from the digital camera or sensor 100 such that a specific weight is applied to a specific image via hadamard multiplication. a tier 2 calibration takes place when the diagnostic analyzer is moved to its production location. variations in input power are managed via the use of a texas instruments tlc5923 integrated circuit ( for details see, kouzo ichimaru, temperature compensated constant - voltage circuit and temperature compensated constant - current circuit, u. s. pat. no. 5, 430, 395 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety ) which implements a temperature compensated constant current circuit that also incorporates error information circuitry allowing the detection of broken or disconnected led devices. obtaining the required front to back image contrast is obtained by adjusting the relative amount of power sent to the front and back front illumination light emitting diode circuit boards, 602 and 603, respectively. based upon the green image, the ratio of the average intensity of the front illuminated image compared to the average intensity of the back illuminated image is set to a predetermined value. this provides the required front to back contrast. variations in gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 sensitivity including illumination variability are addressed by repeating the tier 1 calibration obtaining a new matrix of multiplicative weights. this compensates for variations in gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 sensitivity including illumination variability and also compensates for variations in ambient lighting plus any variations in illumination intensity caused by the first two steps of the tier 2 calibration procedure. a tier 3 calibration or more precisely, compensation for electrical component degradation over time is achieved by exploiting known hardware behavior. for example, it is well known that light emitting diodes produce less light output per unit input power as a function of the number of hours of use. in particular, this decrease in light output as a function of the cumulative time the diode has been emitting light, based on the duty cycle, can be modeled and used to obtain a first order image correction matrix to maintain the imaging subsystem in calibration over a longer time span. the image correction matrix elements would vary as a function time depending upon the total number of hours that the led has been emitting light. for details, see anthony p. zygmunt, chein hsun wang, and j. anthony spies system and method for led degradation and temperature compensation, us 2010 / 0007588 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. compensation for electrical component temperature sensitivity is achieved via the texas instrument tlc5923 integrated circuit as referenced above. a tier 4 calibration consists of performing tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 calibrations again in sequence. generally occurs after all calibration procedures have been executed and is the normal operating mode of the imaging subsystem. the prior qualitative discussion of fig2 and 3 can be made quantitative by the introduction of numerical values for intensity. it is common for a byte or eight bits of a computer word to represent the intensity value of a pixel. this allows for : intensity levels in the range of [ 0, 255 ]. it is also common to describe the range of intensity using a floating point number in the range of [ 0. 0, 1. 0 ] as employed in matlab. this latter construct will be used in describing the following preferred method. note that the exemplary image sizes used in the following examples is much smaller than real images that may have many thousands of rows and columns. where there are two rows of red pixels ( r ), two rows of green pixels ( g ), two rows of blue pixels ( b ), two rows of black pixels ( k ), and two rows of white pixels ( w ). upon exposure to red, green, or blue wavelength light, the reflection intensity of the above image will be recorded as a 10 10 matrix of values in the closed interval [ 0. 0, 1. 0 ]. for example, a uniform exposure to green wavelength light of intensity 0. 8 would ideally produce the following green image plane, in reflection intensities, for a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100 : however, achieving a uniform exposure is difficult and there could be, for example, a gradient in exposure from left to right which might produce the following green image plane : such non - uniformities in exposure can be handled via the use of a green weight matrix whose numerical elements would have values determined by the calibration procedure that, once applied, would be capable of producing a corrected green color plane. for exposure gradients as in a green prime above, the following green weight matrix ( with numerical values to two decimal places ) could be employed : where the operation ( * ) denotes the element - by - element multiplication of the matrix elements as defined in matlab ( see getting started with matlab 7, september 2010, the math works, inc., pages 2 - 24 and 2 - 25, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety ) and is also known as the hadamard product. note that for this particular example that to a couple of decimal places, that is to say that essentially perfect correction would be obtained. in a similar manner, corrections for alternative exposure geometries can be implemented. as an additional example, suppose the green wavelength exposure was a point source such that maximum intensity from the source was directed to the center of the object being imaged. the point source exposure ( in intensity ) would then have a decreasing gradient, in a radial direction, to pixels at increasing distances from the center of the object being imaged. a weight matrix in this case would have the lowest numerical values at the center with increasing numerical values as a function of the distance from the center to compensate for the radial falloff in exposure intensity. in addition to exposure geometry corrections, other digital image corrections such as compensation for the long - term degradation of output intensity of leds as a function of age and / or compensation for the spectral response or sensitivity of the gray - scale being employed. in any event, the resulting weight matrices can be combined into a single weight matrix to account for all corrections being employed as follows : where the ( * ) operation denotes the multiplication of the a green gain scalar by each element of the resulting hadamard matrix multiplication on the right. further corrections are also possible, for example, it is possible that both the peak relative intensity and the area under the relative intensity response or sensitivity curve could vary significantly as a function of light wavelength. hence, for a specific intensity exposure, the reflection intensity of red might only be a fraction of the reflection intensity of green or blue. likewise, for a gray - scale digital camera or sensor 100, the spectral response or sensitivity to red light might also only be a fraction of the reflection intensity of green or blue. this variability is most easily compensated for by having a scalar gain correction for each wavelength exposure. specifically, green exposure reflection intensity combined with a green spectral response or sensitivity of the gray - scale could be corrected by applying a gain scalar to the previously determined exposure correction equation for geometry as follows : where the ( * ) operation denotes the multiplication of the a green gain scalar by each element of the resulting hadamard matrix multiplication on the right. in aggregate, the correction processing is carried out plane - wise as follows : a red totally corrected = a red gain ( * ) a red weight ( * ) a red measured a green totally corrected = a green gain ( * ) a green weight ( * ) a green measured a blue totally corrected = a blue gain ( * ) a blue weight ( * ) a blue measured it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the methods and processes of this invention. thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations, provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. the disclosure of all publications cited above is expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to the same extent as if each were incorporated by reference individually.",the invention relates generally to both a method and apparatus for the creation of full resolution color digital images of diagnostic cassettes or objects of interest using a gray - scale digital camera or sensor combined with time sequential illumination using additive primary colors followed by post exposure digital processing . such procedures and equipment is of significant economic value when employed in situations such as diagnostic clinical analyzers where space is limited and image quality requirements are high .
"initially, reference is made to fig1 which shows a navigation system according to the present invention in block diagram. as shown in the figure, the navigation system is comprised of a processor 1, a location detector 2, a clock section ( timer ) 3 having a calendar function such as years, months, days and days of week, a keyboard 4, a cd - rom reader 5, map data 6 stored in a cd - rom, a plotting processor 7, a picture memory 8, a display control section 9, a display section 10 and a voice output section 11. designated by reference numerals 12 and 13 are transportation means operational schedule data ( timetable, etc. ) stored in the cd - rom and traffic information receiver. the processor 1 reads the current location of a vehicle carrying the navigation system from the location detector 2, which is formed of a gps receiver and the like. the current location is represented in the form of absolute positions of the earth, such as x degrees of north latitude and y degrees of east longitude. based on the read current location and display magnification, designated by a command input through the keyboard 4, of a picture to be displayed, the processor 1 computes the latitude of the top and bottom marginal edges and the longitude of the right and left marginal edges of the picture to be displayed. then, the processor 1 reads, by means of the cd - rom reader 5, map data, which may be accommodated within a field defined by the computed top and bottom and right and left marginal edges, from the map data 6 stored in the cd - rom and transfers the read map data to the plotting processor 7. the plotting processor 7 receives the map data transferred from the processor 1, executes the command contained in the map data to generate graphic data in the form of dot patterns, representative of roads, railroads and stations, which are component elements of the relevant map, and writes the graphic data in a predetermined portion of the picture memory 8. the plotting processor 7 transforms character codes contained in the map data received from the processor 1 into corresponding dot pattern characters and writes the resulting data in a predetermined portion of the picture memory 8. the map in the form of dot patterns, wrote in the picture memory 8, are periodically read under the control of the display control section 9 and displayed on the display section 10 formed of a liquid crystal panel or a braun tube ( crt ). in the map displayed on the display 10, the current vehicle location detected by means of the location detector 2 is displayed by way of predetermined codes. the processor i communicates speech information necessary for the navigation to a vehicle driver through the voice output section 11 having a loud speaker, etc. apart from the features required for a known navigation system, the navigation system according to the preferred embodiment being described includes operational schedule data ( timetable, etc. ) 12 of transportation means, stored in the cd - rom required for displaying operational schedule information of the transportation means, and the traffic information receiver 13. the operation schedule data 12 of the means of transportation include railroads and names of bus - route streets, which are present in each area defined by latitudinal and longitudinal limits in combination ; operational timetable of trains and buses that move or run along the railroads and streets ; and locations of each train and bus, which are defined jointly by the latitude and longitude at each predetermined time interval. by reading the transportation means data 12 via the cd - rom reader 5, the processor 1 retrieves railroads and roads which are present in a display area defined by the latitudinal and longitudinal limits in combination and being displayed on the display 10, determines the locations of trains and / or buses operating on or along the railroads and roads and communicates their display positions to the plotting processor 7. upon receipt of such communication, the plotting processor 7 writes graphics of the trains in that portion of the picture memory 8 which corresponds to the display positions of the trains and writes graphics of the buses in that portion of the picture memory 8 which corresponds to the display positions of the buses. as a result, the current locations of train a1 and bus a2 are displayed on the screen of the display section 10 together with the location p of the vehicle represented by a triangle, as illustrated in fig2. as the vehicle approaches a railroad crossing, the vehicle driver may be warned of an approaching train by way of a message or a buzz through a loud speaker and the like of the voice output section 11. as the driver inputs through the keyboard 4 a command for displaying the operation timetable of the train being displayed, the operation timetable of the displayed train is displayed at a corner of the screen, as shown in fig3. to simplify operation for the driver, the display section 10 may preferably be in the form of a touch - panel designed to display such operational schedule by pressing with a finger of the driver the graphics of the train being displayed. when desired, the driver can input a command through the keyboard 4, which forms a command input section, so that the operation time table of a train following the train being displayed may be displayed. it is also possible to display the current location of a particular train on the screen by inputting the name or identification number of the train through the keyboard 4. traffic information receiver 13 receives the operation conditions of transportation means, transmitted via a radio circuit, and transmits the received data to the processor 1. based on the operation conditions transmitted from the traffic information receiver 13, the processor 1 adjusts the current location of the train or bus, as well as the operation timetable thereof. referring now to the flow charts of fig4 - fig6 operation of the navigation system according to the present invention will be discussed. fig4 is a flow chart showing the operation for map retrieval by use of a cursor. the processor 1 determines a cursor position on the displayed map designated by an image position designator ( pointing device ) such as a mouse and a cursor key of the keyboard 4 as the vehicle remains stable ( s1 ). next, the processor 1 determines the display magnification ( scale level ) of a map to be displayed on the screen ( s2 ). then, the processor 1 determines whether the vehicle of the operator or driver is located within the map area or field displayed on the screen on the designated scale with the designated cursor position at its center ( s3 ) and causes the current location, marked by, for example, a triangle and referenced p, of the vehicle to be displayed when the vehicle is within the map field being displayed ( s4 ). thereafter, the processor 1 determines whether the public transportation means, designated by the driver through the keyboard 4, is positioned within the map field being displayed on the screen ( s5 ) and executes the processing of fig6 when the transportation means is present therein. fig5 is a flow chart showing the operation in which the current vehicle location is displayed. based on the location data output from the location detector 2, the processor 1 determines the current location of the vehicle ( s11 ), whereafter it reads map data incorporating or encompassing the current vehicle location from the cd - rom and displays the corresponding map and the current vehicle location on the screen ( s12 ). thereafter, the processor 1 determines the scale level of the map being displayed on the screen ( s13 ), determines whether the designated transportation means is located within the displayed map field with the current vehicle location at its center ( s14 ) and follows the operation steps of fig6 when the designated transportation means is present therein. fig6 is a flow chart showing operations involved in computing and displaying the location of the designated transportation means. the processor 1 determines the current time and date based on the day / time data of the clock section ( timer ) 3 ( s31 ). next, having reference to the operational schedule data ( diagram data ) of the transportation means designated by the driver, the processor 1 retrieves two nodes ( e. g., train stations and bus stops ) having respective operational schedule data ( diagram data ) and being in close proximity to the vehicle location ( s32 ). then, based on the operational schedule data ( diagram data ) of transportation means, the processor 1 determines whether there is transportation means ( train or bus ) currently operating or running between the two retrieved nodes ( stations or bus stops ) ( s33 ). when there are transportation means currently operating between the two nodes ( stations or bus stops ), the processor 1 estimates the current operational location of the transportation means ( train or bus ) on the basis of the service or operation distance between the two nodes ( stations or bus stops ) and operational schedule data ( diagram data ) ( s34 ) and displays a mark representing the estimate operational location of the transportation means on the screen in merged or synthesized relations with the map also displayed thereon ( s35 ). the processing steps shown in fig4 - fig6 are carried out at predetermined time intervals. these predetermined time intervals should preferably be set to vary depending on the scales of reduction ( scale levels ) of the maps displayed. for example, when a small scale of reduction is employed to display a narrow region of a map on an enlarged scale, the repeat time ( predetermined time ) with respect to the processing steps of fig4 - fig6 should be made short so that the moving location of the running transportation means ( train or bus ) can be precisely displayed. fig7 illustrates example forms of nodes of the means of transportation. different nodes are employed depending on the kinds of transportation means. in the illustrated example, two different nodes are employed, namely, a railroad ( route ) node and a station node. each node has data such as location, distance to an adjacent node and railroad name ( line name ). each station node has the operational schedule ( diagram ) data of the relevant transportation means. fig8 illustrates a screen displaying a picture retrieved from the transportation means operation schedule data 12 in which the operational schedule data of a private airplane a3 flying over the vehicle are incorporated. preferably, the airplane a3 is displayed when a large field is displayed on the screen. in light of the significant differences in speeds of the vehicle and airplane, displaying the airplane a3 on the screen would rather serve for the purpose of amusement than for the purpose of practical uses. although the navigation system according to the embodiment described above is arranged to display trains and buses on the screen in graphic form, alternative arrangements are also possible. for example, the locations of the trains and buses may be displayed by flickering of luminous points lights, instead of by such graphic forms. when desired, the system may be arranged to display only the operation timetable, omitting the location displaying function. the system has been described as incorporating the traffic information receiver 13 so that the operational conditions of trains and buses can be adjusted but such arrangement may be omitted when so desired as to lower the cost of production of the system. contrarily, instead of recording the operational schedule data of the transportation means in the cd - rom in advance, such data may be received by means of the traffic information receiver 13 and stored in a memory within the processor 1. description has been made on the arrangement with the transportation operation schedule data including positions, designated jointly by the latitude and longitude at each predetermined time, of trains and buses. as an alteration, the arrangement may be constructed such that the positions of the trains and buses at each predetermined time will be computed by the processor 1 based upon the time of departure from train stations and bus stops and current time. instead of the mode of display as shown in fig2 a separate mode of display may be employed in which the background map is scrolled in response to movement of the vehicle whilst the vehicle is constantly displayed at the center of the screen. in the scroll mode of display, it is difficult to determine the direction of run and speed of movement of a bus. in this instance, a mode of display may be employed in which display positions are discretely altered every time positional displacement exceeds a predetermined value, instead of continuously varying the bus location. although the system has been described as including trains, buses and private airplanes as examples of the transportation means to be displayed, subways, boats and the like may also be included as the means of transportation. the moving object carrying the navigation system according to the present invention has been described as a vehicle but the navigation system may also be mounted on other moving objects such as boats. as thus far explained in detail, by addition of only the operational schedule data of means of transportation and required processing program, the navigation system according to the present invention is provided with the new function of displaying information relative to the transportation means on the screen, whereby its cost performance is improved. with capability of displaying train information, the system is particularly useful in that when passing an invisible railroad crossing, a train approaching the crossing can be displayed, thus increasing safety at the crossing.","a navigation system includes a cd - rom for storing operational schedule data of transportation means operating along railroad , road and air routes contained in a map to be displayed on a screen of the system , and a display for reading the operational schedule data from the cd -

"referring now to the drawings, two - wavelength interferometer 1 of fig1 includes two lasers having different wavelengths a and b, respectively. laser 2 can be an argon laser producing a beam 4 of light having a wavelength a impinging upon a mirror 5. laser 2 can be switched on and off by means of a signal on bus 41 in response to control circuitry in block 29. similarly, laser 3, which can be a helium - neon laser producing a beam 6 having a wavelength b, also is switched on and off in response to a difference signal or bus 41. beam 6 passes through attenuator 7 to produce beam 9 when laser 3 is switched on. beam 8 is reflected from mirror 5 and also from the surface of mirror 7 to produce beam 9 when laser 2 is on. beam 9 is reflected from mirror 10 to produce beam 11, which enters a microscope objective 12. microscope objective 12 focuses beam 11 onto a pinhole 12a and into a collimating lens 14, as indicated by reference numeral 13. the beam 15 emerging from collimating lens 14 impinges upon a beam splitter 16. the beam 15 is split to produce beams 17 and 22. beam 22 passes through a lens 23 that matches & # 34 ; the best fit sphere & # 34 ; of an aspheric test surface 25 so that the rays 24 impinge approximately perpendicularly onto aspheric test surface 25, and therefore are reflected back through lens 23 and beam splitter 16, contributing to interference beam 26 that passes through imaging lens 27, focusing interference beam 28, onto for example, a 256 by 256 detector array included in block 29. ( in our experiments, however, a 100 by 100 detector array was used. ) reference numeral 41a designates a nonparallel window that reduces effects of interference between surfaces of the window and the detector array. the portion of the interferometer including beam 22, lens 23, and aspheric test surface 25 is referred to as the test arm. the other arm of the interferometer, referred to as the reference arm, includes beam 17 emerging from the lower surface of beam splitter 16 and reference mirror 18. beam 17 impinges upon reference mirror 18, which can be linearly moved in accordance with incorporated - by - reference patent application ser. no. 781, 261 ( now u. s. pat. no. 4, 639, 139 ) mentioned above. beam 20 is reflected from reference mirror 18 onto the surface of a wedge 21 having approximately the same reflectivity as aspheric test surface 25. beam 20 is reflected back to reference mirror 18, and then back to the lower surface of beam splitter 16, which then reflects the reference beam so that it interferes with the reflected test surface beam 22. imaging lens 27 receives the interference beam 26 and focuses the test surface 25 onto the 256 by 256 detector array in block 29, as indicated by 28. bus 42 connects piezoelectric transducer 19 to control circuitry in block 29, synchronizing linear movement of reference mirror 18 with the scanning of the 256 by 256 photodiode detector array 29a in block 29 in accordance with the teachings of above - mentioned co - pending application ser. no. 781, 261. the intensity measured by each photodiode detector in the 256 by 256 array is converted to an analog signal as also described in application ser. no. 781, 261, which analog signal is operated upon by suitable programs stored in computer 40 to compute the optical path difference ( opd ) between the surface of reference mirror 18 and aspheric test surface 25. an equivalent wavelength eq is computed for the present values of a and b being used in accordance with the equation : # # equ1 # # four currents are measured for each photodiode at each of the two - wavelengths a and b, and for each wavelength a or b, the phase of the wavefront detected is computed from the following equation : # # equ2 # # where a, b, c, and d represent the measured currents from the present photodetector at equally spaced time increments as the piezoelectric transducer 19 is linearly shifted. this equation is derived in & # 34 ; installation et utilisation du comparateur photoelectrique et interferential du bureau international des poides et mesures & # 34 ;, carre & # 39 ;, 1966, metrologia, vol. 2, pages 13 - 23. if this equation is used, the same ramping rate can be used for the piezoelectric transducer 19, regardless of the wavelengths of lasers 2 and 3. it should be noted that there are various other techniques for measuring the photodetector array output and shifting the piezoelectric transducer, with different equations for computing the phase at each photodetector. for example, see & # 34 ; contouring aspheric surfaces using two - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry & # 34 ;, by katherine creath, yeou - yen cheng, and james c. wyant, optica acta, 1985, vol. 32, no. 12, p. 1455 - 1464, incorporated herein by reference. also see the above - mentioned co - pending patent application ser. no. 781, 261. if the intensity measurements and phase are obtained using the equations other than the carre equations, the piezoelectric transducer linear ramping voltage slope may have to be adjusted for each wavelength to ensure that the phase is shifted by a precise amount. the computations will be less complex, but the accuracy will be slightly reduced. it has been previously shown, in wyant, 1971, applied optics, vol. 10, page 2113 that an interferogram obtained with two wavelengths has an intensity distribution given by the equation : # # equ3 # # the argument of the cosine term is the equivalent phase eq ( x, y ) and can be written as : # # equ4 # # wherein a and b are the phases measured for a and b, respectively. thus, the difference between a and b measured at the two wavelengths a and b yields the phase eq associated with the equivalent wavelength of the & # 34 ; interference & # 34 ; pattern that would be generated between a and b if two - wavelength holography techniques were utilized. it was not recognized by co - inventor wyant, in spite of considerable reflection by him on the matter, that eq could, as a practical matter, be obtained by equation ( 4 ), because both a and b are computed & # 34 ; modulo 2 & # 34 ; and, in accordance with the nature of the arctangent function, have discontinuities every 360 degrees. it was thought that the discontinuities would be indeterminate for a and b since the intensity measurements were taken at different wavelengths a and b, respectively. one would ordinarily not consider it a practical thing to add or subtract terms with indeterminate or undefined discontinuities in order to obtain a term such as eq that needs to be extremely precise. once the value of eq is obtained in accordance with equation ( 4 ), with a and b being obtained in accordance with equation ( 2 ), the next step ( if desired ) is to compute the equivalent optical path difference in accordance with the equation : # # equ5 # # for each detector element. to operate the two - wavelength phase - shifting interferometer of fig1 lasers 2 and 3 are aligned so that the beams 9 and 11, are colinear up to collimating lens 14. using an uncoated aspheric test surface 25, and using the above - mentioned reticon 100 by 100 photodiode array, the number of interference fringes appearing on the detector array 29a was controlled by positioning the detector array 29a and the imaging lens 27. the wavelength a was either 0. 4880 microns or 0. 5145 microns. b was 0. 6328 microns. at each detector, argon laser 2 is turned on, thereby illuminating the array 29a, and the piezoelectric transducer 19 is shifted by linearly advancing it to allow three or four intensity measurements ( depending on the method of phase computation used ) from that photodiode to be measured and digitized by an analog - to - digital converter and then read by computer 40. the argon laser 2 then is switched off, helium - neon laser 3 is switched on, the piezoelectric transducer returned to its initial point, and the above procedure is repeated for the same photodiode. using an appropriate display or plotting routine that can be executed by computer 40, a three - dimensional contour map of the aspheric surface 25 can be displayed on a screen of computer 40 or plotted on a plotter. fig3 a shows the displayed result obtained using the above - described method, the individual curves representing the equivalent optical path difference opd eq ( x, y ), with tilt being subtracted by the software in a conventional manner. it can be seen that the contour map of fig3 a has no discontinuities. fig3 b shows a contour map of the same aspheric test surface 25 generated using single - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry for the a laser wavelength only. it can be readily seen that there are many discontinuities and inaccuracies in the contour map of fig3 b. it should be noted that eq as computed by equation ( 4 ) must be adjusted by eliminating the above - mentioned 2 ambiguities by adding or subtracting integer multiples of 2 until the difference in eq between successive photodiodes is less than. alternately, 2 ambiguities can be adjusted in opd eq by adding or subtracting integer multiples of eq until the difference in opd eq is less than one - half of eq. it also should be noted that the above technique is only valid if the condition that eq is sufficiently large that there is no more one - half of an & # 34 ; equivalent & # 34 ; fringe ( i. e., eq wavelengths ) between adjacent photodetectors in array 29a. ( & # 34 ; equivalent & # 34 ; fringes are fringes that would be produced by an interference pattern produced by a and b using two - wavelength holography, as described above. ) it should be appreciated that the accuracy of opd eq ( x, y ) is less than the accuracy of opd a or opd b because inaccuracies due to photodetector noise and electronic noise are scaled up by the ratio of opd eq to the single - wavelength optical path difference. if greater accuracy is needed, the technique of the invention can be expanded by using the equivalent opd eq data to determine precisely where to correct the 2 amibiguities in the single - wavelength opd data. how this is accomplished can be understood with reference to fig2. in fig2 curves 30, 31, and 32 designate the optical path difference computed for the single - wavelength & # 34 ; interferogram & # 34 ; 2 discontinuities by measuring aspheric test surface 25. reference numeral 31a designates the first 2 ambiguity, the amplitude of which is indeterminate. reference numeral 30a designates the values of opd a computed until the next indeterminate 2 ambiguity occurs, as indicated by reference numeral 31a. curve 32 designates the values of opd a continuing until the next indeterminate 2 ambiguity 32a. it should be appreciated that the actual optical path difference for the aspheric surface 25 might change a great deal, i. e., much more than a, between adjacent pixels or photodetector elements, if the surface being measured is & # 34 ; steep & # 34 ;, i. e., varies greatly from a spheric surface. therefore, there is no way of knowing how many multiples of a need to be added to ( or subtracted from ) curve 31 to move its left most point up to match point 47, and thereby eliminate the 2 ambiguity 30a. however, the information in curve 33, although much less accurate than that in curves 30, 31, and 32 ( because of the above mentioned scaling ), can be utilized to determine how many multiples of a need to be added to curve 31 to eliminate the 2 discontinuity 30a. note that the & # 34 ; roughness & # 34 ; of curve 33 represents the relative inaccuracy of opd eq compared to opd a. due to the fact that eq is much longer than a, there are no 2 discontinuities in curve 33. therefore, point 47a of curve 33b can be compared with point 47 of curve 30. note that point 47 corresponds to the first photodetector diode or pixel before the 2 discontinuity 30a occurs in fig2 and point 47a corresponds to the first detector after the 2 ambiguity 30a. an integral number of a wavelengths determined by equation ( 6 ) below are added to or subtracted from opd a for curve 31 to cause point 47a to closely match point 47, within one half of a. it should be noted that the above explanation with reference to fig2 of resolving 2 ambiguities can be performed on eq and a which differ from the optical path differences only by the scaling factor 2 / eq or 2 / a. the following equation expresses this computation of the number n of a wavelengths added or subtracted to & # 34 ; resolve & # 34 ; the above - described 2 ambiguity 30a : # # equ6 # # where n is an integer. stated differently, what expression ( 6 ) means is that an integral number of a & # 39 ; s are added to and / or subtracted from a opd a until the difference between that quantity and the equivalent optical path difference opd eq is less than half of a. ( note that this technique yields proper results if there is no chromatic aberration present in the optics of the interferometer. if such errors are present, then a more complex technique is required ). thus, the present invention can result in nearly the same accuracy in measuring a surface as is obtained using short ( visible ), single - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry, while also obtaining the much larger range of optical path differences that can be obtained with two - wavelength holography. comparing this technique with the two - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry techniques described in the above - mentioned cheng and wyant article, much greater accuracy is achieved, and much shorter computation times are achieved. this is because of the simplicity of the computation of equation ( 4 ) above, wherein the equivalent phase eq is computed by simply subtracting the computed quantity b from a and computing opd eq from equation ( 5 ) for each photodiode. if a particular photodiode produces an erroneous signal, due to externally induced noise or an intrinsic junction defect, that error will affect only one value of opd eq. all other values of opd eq obtained will be independent of that error. in contrast, in the cheng and wyant reference, the differences in the opds between each adjacent pair of photodiodes is obtained by subtraction, and these differences are summed, as indicated in equations ( 9 ) in the cheng and wyant reference, wherein any error occurring as a result of nise or other inaccuracy, including computational round - off errors, occurring in any first pixel or photodiode will be added to the optical phase difference computed for every subsequently scanned photodetector. thus, while the technique described in the cheng and wyant article represents a significant advance in the art, the present above - described invention results in a significant improvement that finally makes two - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry a highly practical means of reducing the costs of testing aspheric optical components, making the total manufacturing costs thereof much less than has been the case up to now. a computer algorithm, subsequently described with reference to the flow chart of fig4 a, was written to make the computations of equations ( 2 ), ( 4 ), and ( 7 ). during the phase calculations, saturated data points, wherein overly large photodiode currents were generated, and points wherein the modulation of the currents or intensity from one pixel or photodiode to the next were too small, were neglected. referring now to fig4 a, which shows the above - mentioned flow chart, the algorithm is entered at label 50. in block 51, laser 2 is switched on. the program then goes to block 52 and causes the control circuitry 29b to cause appropriate ramping of the reference mirror 18 by the piezoelectric transducer 19 and scanning of the detector array 29a to obtain the four measurement a, b, c, and d. the program stores a, b, c, and d and then goes to block 53, switches off laser 2, and switches on laser 3. in block 54, the program initializes the position of the piezoelectric transducer 19. in block 55, the program again causes ramping of the piezoelectric transducer and scanning of the detector array 29a, exactly as in block 52, and stores the four resulting measurements of e, f, g, and h. next, the program goes to block 56 and computes the phases a and b, wherein a is a function a, b, c, and d and b is a function of e, f, g, and h. these calculations are made in accordance with equation ( 2 ) above ; the details of the computations are shown in the flow chart of fig4 b. next, the program goes to block 57 and uses equation ( 4 ) to compute eq. the program then goes to block 58, and computes eq in accordance with equation 1 and computes opd eq in accordance with equation ( 5 ). then the program goes to block 59 and removes the 2 ambiguities from eq and from a in accordance with the above - described techniques. finally, the program goes to block 60, displays the corrected optical path differences, and exits at label 61. referring now to fig4 b, the subroutine for computing the phases, as explained above with reference to block 56, is entered at label 65. first, the program sets a variable called pixel to 1. the program then goes to decision block 67 and determines if the present value of pixel is equal to 256 2 ( assuming that a 256 by 256 photodetector array is being used ). if the determination of block 67 is affirmative, the algorithm is exited at label 68. otherwise, the program goes to block 69 and computes the temporary variables d 1, d 2, and d 3 as illustrated. the program then goes to block 70 and computes the temporary variables d 4, num ( numerator ), and den ( denominator ). the algorithm then goes to block 71 and computes the quantity mod ( modulation ), which is equivalent to equation ( 7 ) above. next, the program goes to decision block 72 and determines if any of a, b, c, or d has a value that exceeds a predetermined & # 34 ; saturation & # 34 ; level that indicates too much incident light on the corresponding photodetector, or if the modulation variable mod is less than a predetermined minimum threshold. if the determination of block 72 is affirmative, the program goes to block 73 and determines that the data from the present pixel or photodetector is invalid by setting a flag corresponding to that pixel of the photodetector array, so that it can be later recognized as a bad point, increments pixel, and returns to decision block 67. if the determination of block 72 is negative, the program goes to decision block 74 and determines if den is equal to zero. if the determination of decision block 74 is affirmative, the program goes to decision block 75 and determines if the variable d 2 is greater than zero. if den is 0, then the phase has certain values meaning that the arctangent has become infinite, so depending on the sign of the sine term, the phase is given a value of / 2 or 3 / 2, as indicated in blocks 76 and 77. referring to block 78, since an arctangent calculation will only give a phase modulo because of the signs in the numerator and denominator of the equation, an ambiguity can occur there. absolute values of num and den are computed to avoid this. in blocks 79 through 85 it is determined in which cartesian coordinate quadrant 2, 3, or 4 to place the phase. then added to the phase or the phase is subtracted from 2 or, as indicated. the final part of this calculation is to check if the numerator is equal to 0 in block 85. if the numerator is equal to 0, then the phase is set to either 0 or depending on whether the denominator is less than or greater than 0. at that point, the program goes to block 75a and increments pixel. note that appendix a, affixed hereto, includes a printout of an operating program executed by computer 40 and including the calculations corresponding to the flow charts of fig4 a and 4b. the three dimensional countour map shown in fig3 a was obtained for the two - wavelength technique described above, while the corresponding contour map of fig3 b was obtained using only the single - wavelength a. the technique described above with reference to equation 6 could be used to correct all of the obvious errors in fig3 b to provide a contour map resembling, but more accurate than, the contour map of fig3 a. the fundamental limit to the above - described technique is the ratio of detector size to the fringe spacing. if many fringes are incident upon a single detector element, the intensity measured will, in effect, be an & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; over the detector area. then, when the phase is shifted by the piezoelectric transducer 19, such points, or more particularly, the measured intensities or photocurrents, will not be & # 34 ; modulated & # 34 ; ( i. e., change from one intensity measurement to the next as the phase is shifted by the motion of the piezoelectric transducer ) sufficiently to allow an accurate phase computation to be made. to avoid this problem, the size of the detector should be small compared to the a and b fringe spacing to ensure sampling of one fringe at a time as the phase is shifted by motion of the piezoelectric transducer. we are experimenting with holes 2, 5, and 10 microns in diameter in order to obtain a suitable trade off between accuracy of computation and loss of light received by the individual photodiodes. the sensitivity of two - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry is limited by the equivalent wavelength used. since single - wavelength phase - shifting interferometry is generally precise to a / 100 to a / 1000, the above described technique should measure surface defects of the order of 100 to 1000 angstroms for an equivalent wavelength eq equal to 10 microns or 10 to 100 angstroms after correcting ambiguities in the single wavelength data. one technique for reducing the ratio between the effective photodetector area ( size of pixel ) and the distance between & # 34 ; equivalent & # 34 ; fringes is to utilize a mask plate 43, shown in fig5 a. mask plate 43 includes an array of minute holes 44 that are centered over and aligned with each of the photodetector array elements in array 29a. unfortunately, this technique reduces the amount of light that reaches the photodetector cells, reducing the photocurrents produced by each, possibly resulting in an undesirable reduction in accuracy. to offset the reduction in photocurrents produced by the interference pattern focused by the optics onto the detector array 29a, either more laser power is needed, or else a light intensifier device 46 can be mounted between mask plate 43 and the detector array 29a, fig5 b, and a fiberoptic bundle 45 can be aligned with and positioned between the intensifier 46 in the detector array 29a, as also shown in fig5 b, preventing further loss of light rays. various suitable image intensifiers are commercially available, for example from itt or litton. such intensifiers have a photocathode which responds to incident light followed by a microchannel plate which intensifies the signal, whose output activates a phosphor, producing larger amounts of light. it should be appreciated that in using phase - shifting interferometry techniques, if the light signal falling on a particular photodetector cell is low for any reason, or if for some reason one of the two interferometer beams is much brighter than the other, there can be a considerable inaccuracy in the computed phase and optical path difference for that photodiode. as far as we know, no one has published a really good technique for determining whether or not the phase computations are accurate or inaccurate as a result of too low light intensity or saturation of a particular photodetector cell. in the past, we have compared the intensity measurements from adjacent photocells, and eliminated data points corresponding to photocells from which the measured intensity varies less than a preselected amount from that of the previously scanned photocell. as mentioned previously, this technique results in accidental discarding of a considerable amount of good data, reducing the accuracy of the overall countour map of the aspheric surface 25. in accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the following equation is utilized to compute the fringe modulation, or contrast : # # equ7 # # this expression is easily derived from the above carre equations ( equations 10 ) of the creath et al., assuming that the phase - shift is close to / 2. the quantity is the constant preceding the cosine terms in the above mentioned equations for a, b, c, and d of the above mentioned carre & # 39 ; equations. thus, is the amplitude of the variation of the quantities a, b, c, and d, and can be interpreted as the contrast of the interference fringes. we have found that if the fringe contrast is less than an experimentally determined threshold value, which depends on the ambient level of electrical noise and the amount of intrinsic photodetector junction noise, the accuracy of the phase plots and / or contour plots obtained is increased considerably over that previously available using prior techniques for eliminating bad data points. it should be noted that chromatic aberration of interferometers can be minimized by proper design thereof. first, beam splitter 16 can be a membrane beam splitter called a pellicle. the microscope objective collimating lens combination 12 and 14, lens 23, and lens 27 all should be designed so that they are achromatic at the wavelengths a and b. this means that the design is such that the image of the aspheric test surface is the same size and location for both a and b. while the invention has been described with reference to several particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiments of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope thereof. for example, there may be various techniques for computing the eq at each detector without computing the phase for that detector at each of the two wavelengths, and instead computing eq from the intensity measurements of that detector at each wavelength. such techniques nevertheless would distinguish over the cheng and wyant reference by providing computation of eq at each detector point independently of the values computed for the other detector points, and thereby avoid the accumulation of any errors due to electronic noise, pn junction noise, or round - off errors at the other detector points. although an array of photodetectors is disclosed, it would be possible to instead use a single detector and means for providing relative movement between a single detector and the interferogram to accomplish the intensity measurements. it should be appreciated that those skilled in the art can derive a variety of expressions for eq as a function of the intensities measured at each of the two wavelengths a and b that do not involve computing a and b. such expressions can be derived from the above - mentioned carre & # 39 ; equations or from various other equations representing intensities of the interferogram at different phase shifts that are known to those skilled in the art. it should be appreciated that equation ( 7 ) will be different for each different mathematical technique for computing phase. it also should be noted that various other techniques for obtaining phase shifts can be accomplished other than by shifting the reference mirror. appendix 2 provides an example of such a derivation. # # spc1 # # and i o are normalized to be the same for both a and b. the particular intensity equations are well - known equations that require a 90 phase shift between measurements. the equations ( 1 ) above correspond to four intensity measurements at each detector at a first wavelength a. equations ( 2 ) represent four corresponding intensity measurements at b for the same phase shifts. equations ( 3 ) through ( 6 ) show a way of combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) represent a way of combining equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) from which equation ( 9 ), for the equivalent phase. equation ( 10 ) shows that eq can be computed without computing a and b.","an improved apparatus and method are described for accurately &# 34 ;

"the present invention relates to a holographic direct - view display with at least one controllable spatial light modulator which comprises modulator cells 7, 7 which are arranged in a matrix 7, and where each modulator cell 7, 7 is assigned to an apodisation mask 6, 6 which has an apodisation function. the light modulator modulates the phase and / or amplitude of sufficiently coherent light. the phase and / or amplitude values which are encoded on the light modulator can for example represent a hologram which serves to reconstruct a three - dimensional object in a holographic direct - view display. various combinations of light modulator and apodisation masks are possible. for example, a light modulator which modulates the phase only can be combined with an apodisation mask which apodises the amplitude only, and vice versa. generally, both light modulator and apodisation mask can be used for a complex - valued modulation. determining the apodisation function for apodisation masks of modulator cells according to this invention is based on the approach that in addition to the fix initial values target values are defined for parameters to be set. here, a complex amplitude shall specifically be set in the far field of the slm which corresponds with the fourier plane of the slm. the complex amplitude is realised by way of a fourier transformation from the slm to the far field. specifically, the parameter of luminous intensity in the fourier plane is given. the luminous intensity shall be widely reduced in preferred diffraction orders or just in a selected range of the preferred diffraction orders. the shape of the active region of a modulator cell represents the position of the diffraction orders in the far field and thus in the fourier plane. since for example in a holographic direct - view display the observer eyes are situated there as well, diffraction orders of the hologram which is encoded on the slm and which is intended for the left eye can hit the right eye and interfere with the hologram which is intended for the right eye, and vice versa. thanks to the combination of modulator cells of the light modulator and apodisation mask, an apodisation function in an apodisation mask which is computed with the respective parameters causes the incident light to be modulated such that the intensity values in the fourier plane come very close to the intensity profile which is given there or which are identical to that latter. another parameter for the apodisation function can be a phase function with constant amplitude. other parameters in conjunction with the light modulation which are not specifically mentioned here can also be optimised with the method according to this invention for determining an apodisation function for apodisation masks. the target values can be approximated with the help of an iterative process according to an embodiment of the present invention, thus optimising the intensity profile. the apodisation masks are designed as an array and are disposed ideally as close as possible to the light - modulating optical layer of at least one slm. the array is either disposed directly on at least one slm as an additional front or rear layer or integrated into the cover glass of the at least one slm. further, the division bars between the active regions of a modulator cell can already be designed such that they have the effect of an apodisation array. the apodisation masks are aligned with the given arrangement of modulator cells. according to an embodiment, in addition to the slm on which e. g. hologram values of a 3d scene are encoded, the holographic direct - view display can comprise a prism array which comprises electrowetting cells as a further slm which preferably modulates a wave front in its direction of propagation, but which can also modulate the phase and / or amplitude of that wave front. fig1 a shows schematically a top view of a holographic direct - view display according to the prior art, i. e. without apodisation mask. the numeral 1 denotes a holographic display device, 2 l and 2 r denote the reconstruction beams of an object point 5 of a three - dimensional scene, 3 l and 3 r denote the visibility regions, also referred to as observer windows, for a respective left and right observer eye in the far field of the display device 1, and 4 denotes the intensity distribution in the visibility region 3 r for the right observer eye. the intensity distribution 4 of the reconstruction beam 2 r also shows the occurring higher diffraction orders, which cause crosstalking, thus adversely affecting the left observer eye. fig1 b shows schematically a top view of a holographic direct - view display according to this invention with an array of apodisation masks 6 on the display device 1. the reconstruction beam 2 r of the object point 5 generates in the visibility region 3 r for the right observer eye an intensity distribution 4. at the position of the left observer eye the higher diffraction orders of this intensity distribution 4 are reduced such that 20 they do not disturb the other observer eye. fig2 is a graphic representation which shows an apodisation function which can be realised in an apodisation mask for a modulator cell. this apodisation function uniformly reduces diffraction orders starting with the 2nd order of diffracted light according to a target. the exemplary computation was only performed for one dimension in this figure. generally, the areal extent of the modulator cell in two dimensions must be considered in the computation. in the example, the modulator cells are assumed to have a rectangular shape and thus to exhibit a rectangular transmittance curve. for computing the apodisation function it is important to know the distance between two adjacent modulator cells of the light modulator. this allows the location of the diffraction orders to be found precisely in a matrix of modulator cells, in particular if only individual higher diffraction orders are to be reduced. knowing the distance is less important if the intensities are to be reduced in contiguous ranges of neighbouring diffraction orders. at a defined position at a distance d from the light modulator, a diffraction order has the extent d / p in one dimension, where is the wavelength of the light and p is the distance ( pitch ) between the centres of two adjacent modulator cells of the same given group in that dimension. fig3 shows the diffraction pattern of a single modulator cell with and without apodisation mask in the fourier plane of the light modulator, where the amplitudes are shown on a logarithmic scale. curve k 1 shows the diffraction pattern which is computed without apodisation as a sinc function for a rectangular transmittance which is constant across the aperture of the modulator cell. such a transmittance profile where the amplitude is set to the value 1 at all scan points within the aperture of the modulator cell is also used as the initial value for the iterative process with which curve k 2 was computed. in a modulator cell with an aperture which is as large as the cell distance, the distance between two minima of the sinc function would correspond with the extent of a diffraction order. if the aperture is smaller than the cell distance, the diffraction orders are smaller by the same ratio of aperture and cell distance. the curve k 2 shows an amplitude profile in the fourier plane which was computed with the help of the iterative process, resulting from the apodisation function of fig2. the iterative process was terminated after five iteration steps and the result was used in the computation of the apodisation function. the relative intensities of the higher diffraction orders of k 2 in the diagram left and right of the central lobe are clearly reduced compared to k 1. because here a symmetrical reduction of the positive and negative diffraction orders was stipulated, the result of the computation is a distribution of real amplitude or intensity values in the apodisation function. this apodisation function can be realised in a first embodiment of an apodisation mask for uniform reduction of higher diffraction orders. the result of the computation is qualitatively similar to the curve which would be obtained with conventional analytical apodisation functions. the example shows that the iterative process can also be applied to a general case. the advantages of using the iterative process for modifying an apodisation function will become even clearer in the second embodiment. the diagrams in fig4 to 6 illustrate a second embodiment of an apodisation mask in which an apodisation function is realised which only reduces negative diffraction orders. an application of such an embodiment would be a holographic direct - view display with a light modulator where one group of modulator cells are used for the generation of a visibility region for the left eye and another group of modulator cells are used for the generation of a visibility region for the right eye. in a light modulator of a holographic display for generating a reconstruction, the fourier plane is at the same time the plane where the visibility region is situated in which the reconstruction is visible. cross - talking of the left visibility region to the right eye is then e. g. only affected by the intensity in preferred positive diffraction orders of the respective group of modulator cells. cross - talking from the right visibility region to the left eye is only affected by negative diffraction orders of the other group of modulator cells, so that only the negative diffraction orders of that other group must be reduced. fig4 shows the amplitude profiles of the diffraction pattern in the fourier plane scaled to 1 for a reduction of diffraction orders with a cosine - shaped curve of the apodisation function ( curve k 3 ) and the result of the iterative computation with a reduction only of negative diffraction orders ( curve k 4 ). the intensity profile of curve k 4 was computed with iteration steps. this reduces the negative higher diffraction orders about as well as with the cosine - shaped apodisation function. the positive higher diffraction orders are about as high as in the diffraction pattern of the rectangular transmittance profile without apodisation, i. e. of the sinc function k 1 in fig3. as regards the remaining intensity in the higher diffraction orders, using only the negative diffraction orders does not show any advantage in this embodiment. the advantage will only become clear when the apodisation profile in the modulator cell is considered which causes the respective reduction of negative orders. fig5 and 6 are graphic representations of an amplitude profile and of a phase profile of an apodisation function of complex values across a modulator cell according to fig4. fig5 shows in addition to the curve m 4 of the amplitude profile of complex values the amplitude profile of a cosine - shaped apodisation as curve m 3. in this cosine 10 shaped apodisation, the phase is constant across the modulator cell. the amplitude profile of the cosine - shaped apodisation function causes light to be absorbed in the marginal areas of the modulator cell. altogether, an apodisation mask which is provided with this apodisation function clearly reduces the total transmittance of a modulator cell. it is 50 % if the apodisation is only carried out in one dimension, and 15 25 % in the case of a two - dimensional cosine apodisation. the 50 % correspond with the mean value of the squared cosine ( intensity = amplitude squared ) between / 2 and / 2. this reduces the luminous intensity in the higher diffraction orders relative to the zeroth diffraction order, but the absolute intensity will disadvantageously be reduced equally in all diffraction orders, including the zeroth one. this cannot be seen in fig4. there, the amplitude profiles are normalised to 1 to facilitate the comparison of the reduction of higher orders. in contrast, the transmittance with the apodisation function which is found using the iterative process is much higher. referring to fig5, the amplitude of the curve m 4 and thus the intensity is almost 1 in the central region of the modulator cell, and it declines slightly towards the edges. the restriction to the reduction of negative higher diffraction orders shows an about equally good result in these diffraction orders, but without the above - mentioned disadvantage of a substantial loss in intensity in the other used diffraction orders. the resulting apodisation function is complex - valued, because the reduction of higher orders is not symmetrical to the zeroth order. due to the symmetrical behaviour of the diffraction orders, an apodisation function for the reduction of all positive higher diffraction orders can be obtained without a new iterative process in that the amplitude profile of the apodisation function is chosen to be the same, but the phase profile is mirrored. in a holographic direct - view display with a light modulator where one group of modulator cells is used for the generation of a visibility region for the left eye and another group for the right eye, the apodisation mask would have the amplitude profile as shown in fig5, curve m 4, for all modulator cells. as regards the phase profile, however, one group of modulator cells would have the profile as shown in fig6, and the other group would have a phase profile which is mirrored to this phase profile. it becomes apparent from what has been said above that the modified profile of the apodisation function cannot be described simply by one equation. the second embodiment shows that the method can be used generally in applications where no analytic apodisation functions are known. a further optimisation of the apodisation function is possible if not all positive or all negative higher diffraction orders are reduced, but only preferred diffraction orders. in the holographic direct - view display discussed here, these are preferably those diffraction orders which hit the neighbouring eye. which orders are embraced by this definition depends on parameters like the cell distance ( pitch ) of the modulator cells and the preferred observer distance to the display. the affected orders can for example be the + 3rd and + 4th or the 3rd and 4th diffraction order. in a holographic direct - view display where the modulator cells are not fixedly assigned with the left or right eye, it can make sense to compute the apodisation function such that preferred orders such as the + 3rd and + 4th or the 3rd and 4th diffraction order are reduced in the same way for all modulator cells. this applies for example to holograms which are displayed sequentially to the left and right eye. alternatively, it applies to an observer tracking feature in a display which assigns a certain modulator cell to the left eye for one observer position and to the right eye for another observer position. cross - talking to the respective other eye can then be reduced on either side with the same modulator cells. such an apodisation function has advantages over the uniform reduction of all higher diffraction orders. fig7 shows the amplitude profile k 5 normalised to 1 of the diffraction pattern in the fourier plane for a reduction of a region of preferred diffraction orders ( indicated by arrows in the diagram ). here, the reduction is better than with a cosine - shaped apodisation by the curve k 3 in fig4. fig8 shows the amplitude profile of curve m 5 over a modulator cell according to fig7. because of the symmetrical profile, the apodisation function is here revalued again. the phase is also constantly zero. with a transmittance of about 62 % relative to a modulator cell without apodisation mask, the transmittance is higher than in the case of a cosine - shaped apodisation, where it would amount to about 50 % only. in other applications, the iterative computation with an according definition of target values can also yield an increase in the intensity values of preferred diffraction orders. fig9 shows schematically a detail with regularly arranged modulator cells 7, 7 of a light modulator, each of which being assigned with an apodisation mask 6, 6 with a one dimensionally computed apodisation function. one - dimensional here means that the amplitude and phase values of the apodisation function only change in one direction, here horizontally, and are the identical in the orthogonal direction, here vertically, for different positions in the modulator cell 7, 7. further, in this example there is only one group of modulator cells, this means that all modulator cells 7, 7 have the same apodisation function. the diagram in fig1 shows schematically a detail with regularly arranged modulator cells 7, 7, which form two groups of modulator cells. the apodisation mask 6, 6 comprises for both groups a different apodisation function which is additionally always computed two - dimensionally. these groups of modulator cells can be used for different purposes, and the apodisation function is computed separately for each group. two - dimensional here means that the amplitude and phase values of the apodisation function change in two directions, horizontally and vertically, in the modulator cell. fig1 shows schematically the diffraction pattern of a square modulator cell as a greyscale profile in two dimensions, which is realised by a two - dimensional apodisation function. the relative brightness is shown in a non - linear way. this diagram serves as an example for a reduction of a range of preferred diffraction orders. similar to fig1, only those diffraction orders are reduced which would fall on the right or left neighbouring eye if the other eye is situated in the zeroth diffraction order in a holographic direct - view display. the range of reduced diffraction orders is also confined vertically, which is shown in the form of the two black rectangles in the drawing. this result is achieved with an apodisation function which has a transmittance of about 77 %. another example of the application of groups of modulator cells with different apodisation functions is the presentation of 3d objects in colour. in many types of light modulators, a coloured representation is achieved by way of spatial interleaving of modulator cells of different primary colours, which are for example obtained with the help of red, green or blue colour filters. with such spatial interleaving of colours, the modulator cells of each primary colour form a given group, where different apodisation functions are found for each of those groups. if a coherent illumination is used, it must be noted when finding the apodisation function that the width of a diffraction order changes in proportion with the wavelength. in a holographic direct - view display with visibility regions for the left / right eye, where the disturbing cross - talking between the two visibility regions is to be prevented with the help of an apodisation mask, the higher diffraction orders for red, green and blue light have different positions in relation to the neighbouring eye. to achieve a substantial reduction of the diffraction orders, the apodisation function must therefore be computed separately with different set - point values in the fourier plane for the groups of modulator cells of each individual colour. the division of the modulator cells of a light modulator in colour groups can be combined with other systems of group divisions. if in a 3d display modulator cells are additionally fixed assigned to the left or right eye, then those modulator cells for red light and left eye can form one group for which an apodisation function is found, for example. it is a further advantage of this invention that for finding an apodisation function for a group of modulator cells or for at least one light modulator in the holographic directview display an iterative process is carried out only once offline in a computing unit. in contrast to other applications of iterative algorithms, the computational load and the required computing time do not play a role then. now, a method for determining an optimised apodisation function for apodisation masks which are assigned to regularly arranged modulator cells of a spatial light modulator will be described, said method including an iterative process. first, intensity values are defined to serve as set - point values in preferred diffraction orders or sections thereof for a defined position in the optical path for carrying out an iterative process. after having defined an apodisation function as an initial apodisation function, with the help of the known shape and size of a modulator cell of the given group of modulator cells the transmittance profile of the modulator cell is represented by a number of scan points in a grid inside and outside the modulator cell. a transmittance profile is generally understood to be an amplitude profile or an amplitude and phase profile in the form of complex values. the grid of these scan points can be matched to the resolution with which a transmittance profile is technologically feasible to be made across a modulator cell if the point resolution of the manufacturing process is limited. ideally, an analogue transmittance profile is generally desired. for example, a modulator cell with a size of 60 60 m where the transmittance profile is to be realised with a resolution of 1 m can be represented by 60 scan points in each dimension. if it is technologically feasible to manufacture a continuous transmittance profile, the latter can still be approximated in the computation by scan points. the scan points which represent the transmittance profile within the modulator cell are given initial phase and amplitude values. in the most simple case, this can be a rectangular function with the transmittance of 1 within the aperture of the modulator cell, or any other known analytical apodisation function. there is no transmittance outside the aperture of the modulator cell, which is why scan points which are situated there are set to zero. an initial apodisation function is provided with the given initial values, and this function is optimised with the help of an iterative process. it is in particular the distribution of intensity values in the fourier plane of the light modulator which is optimised. the phase and amplitude values are transformed from the plane of the light modulator to its fourier plane, whereby the fourier plane is given a distribution of amplitude values or complex values over multiple diffraction orders. since the computation is performed with the help of a fourier transformation, the number of diffraction orders in the fourier plane which are computed corresponds with the number of scan points within the modulator cell ( aperture and cell margins ), and the number of complex values within a diffraction order in the fourier plane corresponds with the ratio of total number of scan points and scan points within a modulator cell. in the fourier plane, the amplitude values or complex values are replaced by set point values in the given diffraction orders or section thereof, and in the remaining diffraction orders the above - mentioned values are taken from the transformation and back - transformed to the plane of the light modulator. in the plane of the light modulator, the amplitude values or complex values within the aperture of the modulator cells which are computed by way of back - transformation are carried forward to the next iteration step, and the amplitude values or complex values which lie outside the aperture of the modulator cells are set to zero. now, another iteration step with a transformation of the given values to the fourier plane can be started. the iterative process is either terminated after a predefined number of iteration steps, or when another predefined termination criterion is satisfied. it is for example possible to compare the setpoint values in higher diffraction orders with the actual values in the fourier plane before a replacement as a termination criterion. the iteration will be terminated if the deviations of the actual values from the setpoint values falls below a certain threshold. complex values which are the computed result of a fourier transformation between the plane of a light modulator and its fourier plane in one iteration step in one of these two planes are referred to as actual values here. it is possible to introduce further conditions for the cycle of the iterative process. for example, it is possible to specify that the amplitude and phase values are quantized within the modulator cell, and that those quantised values are used for the apodisation function which have the smallest difference to the respective actual value instead of carrying over actual values in each iteration step for the scan points in the modulator cell. for this, the amplitudes of the actual values are preferably normalised such that their range of values matches that of the quantised values. a normalisation to a range of between 0 and 1 can be achieved with the help of a division by the maximum amplitude. such a computation of a quantised apodisation function is particularly sensible if the apodisation function is computed in the context of a certain manufacturing process of the apodisation mask and if only a limited number of different greyscale values or phase values can be realised with that method. a special case of it is a binary apodisation mask which only contains black and fully transparent sections, i. e. two quantisation steps. in another modification of the method, it can be specified that the apodisation function is a phase - only function. a phase function has the advantage that the transmittance of the light modulator is not reduced by the apodisation mask. for a phase function, the phase part of a complex - valued actual value is taken over and its absolute value is set to 1 at the scan points within the aperture of the modulator cell in each iteration step. for reducing only negative or only positive orders, it is for example possible to use a phase - only function. although it delivers remaining intensity values which are somewhat higher in these diffraction orders in contrast to the curve k 4 in fig4, this result is achieved completely without any reduction in transmittance of the light modulator. another option for the termination criterion is to set the amplitude to a minimum value. according to a certain method for manufacturing an apodisation mask, it makes sense to choose the scan points for the computation depending on the size of the modulator cell such that their distance either corresponds with the spatial resolution of that mask or is slightly larger, so that the apodisation mask can be made by way of interpolation between the scan points. the advantage of an iterative process for determining the apodisation function is that an apodisation function which is optimised to the specific application can be computed and realised in an apodisation mask. in contrast, standard apodisation functions only allow a general reduction of the light intensity uniformly in all higher diffraction orders, where the reduction in intensity typically outweighs the intensity which is optimised for a certain higher diffraction order. moreover, the reduction in transmittance of the light modulator is lower when using the apodisation function which is optimised to a certain application than when using a standard apodisation function. the apodisation masks which are provided with the determined apodisation function realise the desired amplitude transparency in the controllable light modulator and thus a reduction of higher diffraction orders. this light modulator can be used in a holographic direct - view display with visibility regions in the fourier plane which are assigned separately to a left / right eye, or in a stereoscopic display for the presentation of spatial objects to observer eyes. in the latter type of display, an illumination with coherent light would be essential. with the help of the apodisation function it is achieved that cross - talking between the visibility regions of the stereo views between left and right eye is minimised. if in the above - mentioned displays a spatial interleaving of visibility regions is realised which are generated at a defined distance to the observer, and if the modulator cells are fixedly assigned to a left or right observer eye, then groups of modulator cells can be specified such that the diffracted light of each group generates visibility regions in the fourier plane which are assigned to the respective observer eyes. the set luminous intensity of the one group is minimised at a given observer distance at the observer eye of the other group and vice versa. in this case, the modulator cells for the left observer eyes exhibit an apodisation function which differs from that of the modulator cells for the right observer eyes. for modulator cells of a controllable light modulator, apodisation masks are designed with which the light modulator can preferably realise an individually specified intensity distribution in the diffraction orders of diffracted coherent light. for this, an apodisation function for the apodisation masks was determined, where target values of luminous intensities in given higher diffraction orders must be considered of in a simplified manner in the computation. it is technologically feasible that the thus modified apodisation function is realised in an apodisation mask. further, it is possible either to give the apodisation function a continuous profile or to realise an apodisation function with discrete values in single steps across the modulator cell in the apodisation mask. this invention also allows to use such amplitude and / or phase profiles in modulator cells as apodisation functions which cannot be described by an analytical function. the apodisation is here preferably made possible with simple functions ( cosine etc. ) or, in the most simple case, with binary steps. further, disturbing margin effects in modulator cells can be weakened by an apodised intensity or phase profile in that for example the margin of the modulator cell is darkened or cut off. this also allows the reconstruction quality to be improved in the visibility region itself. the invention can be applied both in modulators with liquid crystal cells and in modulators with electrowetting cells or other types of cells. the slm and thus the holographic or autostereoscopic displays can either be of a reflective or of a transmissive type. the displays which are described in this invention are direct - view displays. in the case mems - based reflective piston micro - mirror arrays are used as slms, an array of apodisation masks can be realised in that a modulator cell is given a reflectivity gradient.","the invention relates to apodization in a holographic direct view display . known apodization functions are utilized / modified for an apodization mask such that the functions reduce the intensities of selected higher magnitudes of diffractions . the holographic direct view display comprises a controllable light modulator having modulator cells and modulating impinging coherent light into a phase and / or amplitude , and an array of apodization masks . the apodization masks have the same apodization function for a predetermined group of modulator cells , by means of which function a complex amplitude transparency can be set for the modulator cells . this transparency corresponds to an individually predefined course of intensity in a far field of the light modulator , wherein the predefined course of intensity includes a reducing of the light intensity of higher magnitudes of diffractions , and / or of the interfering light emitted by the light modulator ."
"the present invention embodies a method whereby the freshly removed representative oil sample is mixed with a solvent of selected composition and predetermined reagent concentration until a color intensity due to the contaminant concentration or ph value is achieved. this color intensity is manifest in a partitioned layer of the mixture which may be, for example, the lower phase of a two phase liquid system. most importantly, the present invention permits the above - described analysis to proceed in an aqueous medium and eliminates the need of performing the separate step of extracting the contaminants from the oil base before analysis. prior to the invention disclosed herein, it has been necessary to extract the contaminants from the oil by either reacting or complexing the contaminants with appropriate chemicals, removing the so extracted contaminants from the liquid system and thereafter performing analysis for the contaminant concentration. the present invention obviates the extraction by providing a suitable solvent and / or solvent - reagent solution with an aqueous base that effectively isolates the contaminant from the oil and permits an accurate determination of various color wavelengths and intensities in the aqueous layer with minimal interference from the generally opaque oil layer. as used herein, the expression, & # 34 ; freshly removed representative oil & # 34 ; refers to oil that has been removed from a running engine or machine for a short period of time such that a determination of the presence of contaminant material and / or active anti - corrosive additives therein is approximately indicative of concentrations and / or amounts of contaminant material and active anti - corrosive additives in the same oil remaining in the running engine or machine. as further used herein, & # 34 ; active anti - corrosive additive & # 34 ; is meant to include material added to the lubricating oil by the manufacturer which is capable of stabilizing the oil against the harmful increases of acidic and / or basic corrosive materials occurring during the operation of machines or engines in which the oil is placed. as also used herein, the phrase, & # 34 ; used oil & # 34 ; refers to oil which is in place in an operating machine or engine and from which the freshly removed representative oil is withdrawn. the phrase & # 34 ; unused lubricating oil & # 34 ; refers to oil that has not been placed in an operational machine or engine. it is preferred that the unused lubricating oil be eventually placed in the machine or engine in order to further standardize the analysis procedure. the reagents used in the practice of the present invention may be selected from a broad class of chemical compounds exhibiting oxidation - reduction, complexing, and / or acidic or basic properties. when analyzing for contaminants, the following reagents may be used : 1, 10 - phenanthroline, zinc dithiol, chromotropic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, bathocuproine disulphonic acid disodium salt,, & # 39 ; dipyridyl, acetic acid, diphenyl carbazide, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, thioglycollic acid, and phosphomolybdic acid. when analyzing for corrosive material or active anti - corrosive additive, indicators such as thymol blue, methyl orange, methyl green, alizarin, benzopurpurin, 4 - metacresol purple, and congo red - curcumin are useful. the solvents useful in the practice of the present invention may be a combination of chemicals having the ability to complex any contaminant material and / or active anti - corrosive additive existing in the freshly removed oil. as example, the solvent may be a combination of water, isopropyl alcohol ; water, phosphoric acid ; or water, sodium hydroxide, each in a ratio approximating 0. 5 n : 1 n. the inorganic materials capable of being analyzed through the practice of the present invention would include those inorganic materials whose presence is made known by the operation of the machine itself. that is, the inorganic materials may be termed & # 34 ; wear metals & # 34 ; and would include those metals from which the machine is constructed such as, without limitation, iron, lead, copper, chromium, aluminum, nickel, silver, tin, silicon, boron, sodium, phosphorus, zinc, calcium, barium, magnesium, titanium, molybdenum, cadmium, vanadium and antimony. in the present invention, phosphorus is deemed to be a metal since it is often alloyed with one or more other metals for use in constructing machine components. in the present invention, the inorganic contaminants may be metal particles ( the size of which usually varies from generally equal to or greater than about 0. 01 microns ) or the oxides of such metals. generally, when metal oxides are present they exist as surface layers on the particle surfaces. in this regard, the solvents of the present invention act to remove the inorganic contaminants from the oil by dissolving the metal oxides with the reagents thereafter reacting with or complexing the dissolved metal ions to form compounds exhibiting specific color characteristics. further, the solvents and reagents of the present invention may be pre - mixed as a solvent - reagent solution of predetermined solvent and reagent concentration. in order to establish reference points for the analysis of inorganic contaminants in freshly removed oil, organo - metallic standards may be used to provide concentration values selected as low, intermediate, and high values, such as for example 10, 50 and 100 parts per million, for the specific metal contaminants present in the lubricating oil. for example, the organo - metallic standards may be standards commercially available from the conostan division of continental oil co., ponca city, okla. and sold under the trademark conostan. such materials as these are generally regarded as appropriate standards for use in oil analyses. the method of the present invention in analyzing for inorganic contaminants proceeds as follows : a measured volume of a sample of freshly removed oil is placed in an appropriate receptacle such as, for example, a test tube capable of being tightly capped. a measured amount of solvent - reagent solution is added to the tube and thereafter, the sample tube is capped and shaken thoroughly. after shaking, the sample tube is placed in a vertical position to permit the freshly removed representative oil sample to separate from the solvent - reagent. the solvent - reagent phase, which may be found as the bottom layer of a 2 - phase liquid, exhibits a color intensity indicative of the contaminant material existing within the used oil. comparison of this color intensity with color intensity values obtained from practicing the method of the present invention on standard organo - metallic samples provides information indicative of the concentration of the contaminant material existing within the used oil. for example, the representative comparison value for metallic contaminants may be obtained in parts per million. the method of making the above - referenced comparisons is not critical to the present invention. accordingly, such comparisons may be made by standard spectrophotometric methods or by visually comparing the color intensity of the reacted oil sample with the color intensity generated by practicing the present invention on the organo - metallic standards. further, the comparison may also be made by visually comparing the oil - generated color intensity to a color chart which reproduces the color intensities generated by the organo - metallic standards. by testing samples of freshly removed oil at different times, one is thus able to derive data indicative of any increase in concentration of contaminant materials existing within the used oil. in order to further standardize the obtained analytical results, it is preferred that the method disclosed herein be first performed on an unused lubricating oil of the same type and grade that is subsequently to be placed in an operating machine or engine. the color intensity which is obtained from such unused lubricating oil testing may be compared to the standard organo - metallic color intensities in order to derive the approximate concentration of contaminant materials existing within the unused lubricating oil. it is also preferred that one or more analyses be performed on freshly removed oil after the lubricating oil has been placed within the operating environment of the machine or engine. whenever the subsequent analysis establishes that the contaminant level has exceeded a predetermined value, for example 100 parts per million, for a specific metal contaminant, the lubricating oil contains a sufficiently harmful concentration of contaminants to warrant replacement. as a further example, but without limitation, the method disclosed herein may be performed as follows : step 1. place 4. 5 ml of the selected solvent - reagent into a sample test tube capable of being capped ; step 2. place 4. 5 ml of freshly removed oil in the sample test tube used in step 1, and cap the tube ; step 3. shake the mixture resulting from step 2 thoroughly for approximately 15 seconds until the solution is well mixed ; step 4. place the tube in a vertical position and allow to remain unattended for approximately 5 minutes or until the sample and solvent layers achieve separate phases ; step 5. compare the color intensity in the lower layer of the liquid phase to the color intensity of the same phase obtained by performing steps 1 through 4 on an organo - metallic standard to obtain a comparison value indicative of the concentration in parts per million of the contaminant material existing within the lubricating oil. alternatively, the color intensity in the lower layer may be compared to a color chart which accurately reproduces the color intensities generated by the organo - metallic standards. table 1 provides examples of representative solvent - reagent combinations for the analysis of selected metal contaminants. table 1. contaminant solvent reagent iron hydroxylamine, & # 39 ; dipyridil hcl ; watercopper hydroxylamine bathocuproine hcl ; water disulfonic acid disodium saltchromium 85 % phosphoric chromotropic acid acid water disodium salttin water ammonium molybdatenickel water dimethylglyoxime disodium salt ; ammonium tartarate representative solvent and reagent systems for selected inorganic contaminant materials as noted from table 1, analysis for nickel contaminant utilizes a dual reagent system with the water solvent dissolving any metallic oxides present in the oil. in the event oxides other than nickel are present such as, for example, iron, these oxides complex with the ammonium tartrate reagent to form an essentially colorless complex. accordingly, any nickel present complexes with the disodium salt of dimethylglyoxime to form a colored complex. the color intensity of this complex is measured to determine the concentration of nickel existing within the lubricating oil sample. as previously mentioned, oil manufacturers often add active anti - corrosive additives to the oil produced. these additives are useful in stabilizing the oil against the harmful effects created by increases in acidic and / or basic decomposition products which may be formed in the oil during operation of the machines or engines. in this regard, the anti - corrosive additives may be considered as buffers. however, as the acidic and / or basic decomposition products increase in concentration the buffering effect of the additives concommitantly decreases to a point where slight increase in the concentration of the acidic and / or basic products produces a rapid and extreme change in the ph of the lubricating oil. accordingly, the acidic or basic environment produced by this change warrants replacement of the oil with unused lubricating oil. the method of the present invention of determining the presence and concentration of active anti - corrosive additives proceeds as follows : a measured volume of a sample of freshly removed oil is placed in an appropriate receptacle such as, for example, a test tube capable of being tightly capped. a measured amount of solvent - reagent solution is added to the tube and thereafter, the sample tube is capped and shaken thoroughly. after shaking, the sample tube is placed in a vertical position to permit the freshly removed representative oil sample to separate from the solvent - reagent. the solvent - reagent phase, which may be found as the bottom layer of a 2 - phase liquid, exhibits a color indicative of the ph of the oil and further indicative of the concentration of the anti - corrosive additive existing within the used oil. comparison of this color with color values obtained from practicing the method of the present invention on unused lubricating oil samples provides information indicative of the change of ph of the representative sample of freshly removed lubricating oil, hence the change of ph of the oil then in use in the machines or engines. for example, the representative comparison value may be obtained in ph units. the method of making the above - referenced comparisons is not critical to the present invention. accordingly, such comparisons may be made by standard spectrophotometric methods or by visually comparing the color of the reacted oil sample with the color generated by practicing the present invention on the unused oil. further, the comparison may also be made by visually comparing the oil - generated color with a color chart which reproduces the color generated by the unused oil. by testing samples of freshly removed oil at different times, one is thus able to derive data indicative of any change in ph, hence concentration of anti - corrosive additive existing within the used oil. for example, a change in the ph value towards a value of approximately ph 2 represents an increase of acidic corrosive materials in the lubricating oil and a corresponding decrease in the concentration of the active anti - corrosive additive in the lubricating oil. a change in ph value toward a value of ph 10 represents an increase in active anti - corrosive additive concentration and / or an increase in basic contaminant material in the lubricating oil. additionally, an increase in ph towards 10 may also indicate further contamination of the lubricating oil. for example, in certain industries such as the petrochemical industry, machines or engines are used in corrosive atmospheres. in these atmospheres, gaseous materials such as, for example, ammonia may be absorbed by the oil. in this event, the gaseous materials may react with other contaminants in the oil or with water to produce basic compounds which effect the ph of the lubricating oil. in order to further standardize the obtained analytical results, it is preferred that the method disclosed herein be first performed on an unused lubricating oil of the same type and grade that is subsequently to be placed in an operating machine or engine. the color which is obtained from such unused lubricating oil testing may be further compared to the colors generated by practicing the present invention on standardized acidic and / or basic solutions. it is also preferred that one or more analyses be performed on freshly removed oil after the lubricating oil has been placed within the operating environment of the machine or engine. whenever the subsequent analysis establishes that the ph level has exceeded the norm for the specific oil in use, the concentration of the anti - corrosive additive has decreased sufficiently to warrant replacement of the oil. as a further example, but without limitation, the method disclosed herein may be performed as follows : step 1. place 4. 5 ml of the selected solvent - reagent into a sample test tube capable of being capped ; step 2. place 4. 5 ml of freshly removed oil in the sample test tube used in step 1, and cap the tube ; step 3. shake the solution resulting from step 2 thoroughly for approximately 15 seconds until the solution is well mixed ; step 4. place the tube in a vertical position and allow to remain unattended for approximately 5 minutes or until the sample and solvent layers achieve separate phases ; step 5. compare the color in the lower layer of the liquid phase to the color of the same phase obtained by performing steps 1 through 4 on a representative sample of unused oil to obtain an comparison value indicative of the ph of the freshly removed oil and further indicative of the decrease in concentration of the anti - corrosive additive. furthermore, distilled water is an appropriate solvent to use in the practice of this method. the solvent dissolves organic acids, mineral acids and bases, and acidic and / or basic salts that may exist in the lubricating oil sample. additionally, colorimetric reagents such as, for example, a mixture of thymol blue and methyl orange are useful. such mixture permits the determination of the ph of the oil sample from a ph of approximately 2 to a ph of about 10 by providing a reagent which changes color depending upon the ph of the oil. table 2 provides an example of a typical solvent - reagent system together with the absorbance for varying ph values. table 2. solvent - 468 ml distilled waterreagent - 35 ml thymol blue ; 7 ml methyl orangeph absorbance ( m ) 2 490 - 500 ( red ) 4 480 -

reagent and approximately 5 ml of lubricating oil. preferably, each receptacle, prior to receipt by the user, contains a pre - determined volume of a preselected solvent - reagent solution adapted for analysis of a specific contaminant. for example, the receptacle may be a 30 ml volume test tube externally threaded on the open end thereof and adapted to receive a threaded cap 16 thereupon. further, it is preferred that the solvent - reagent solution be pre - mixed by the manufacturer thereof, with the solution being stored in a capped receptacle during shipment. also included in the kit is a dispensing device 18 for measuring a known volume of freshly removed oil and for adding the measured volume to the solvent -

metallic and / or ph standards, the kit is provided with a color chart 22 that accurately reproduces the color intensities for varying concentrations of the several metallic, acidic, and basic contaminants. for example, for each specific metallic contaminant analyzable by the present invention, the color chart may provide representative color intensities for one or more concentration levels, such as 10, 50 and 100 parts per million. thus, after the color is generated for each metal contaminant tested, the intensity is compared to the appropriate color chart intensity level to determine the approximate level of contaminant concentration. determination of the ph of the oil sample proceeds in the same fashion. while the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, alternatives thereto and certain examples, it should be realized that one skilled in the art may make modifications or changes to the invention while still falling within the scope and spirit of the disclosure. accordingly, all such modifications or changes should be deemed to be a part hereof. for example, in the various examples provided herein one volume of solvent - reagent solution is mixed with an approximately equal volume of freshly removed oil sample. one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that this ratio is variable depending on the solvent and reagent concentrations and, therefore, the examples are not meant to be limiting in any manner.","a method and kit for the on -

"the present invention provides a magnetoresistive sensor having improved stability. in one aspect of the present invention, it is recognized that a source of barkhausen noise is the shared shield which forms the lower pole in magnetoresistive transducers having an inductive write element. fig1 is a top view of a disc drive 10 including a magnetoresistive sensor in accordance with the present invention. disc drive 10 includes a magnetic disc 12 mounted for rotational movement about and axis defined by spindle 14 within housing 16. disc drive 10 also includes an actuator 18 mounted to a base plate 20 of housing 16 and pivotally moveable relative to disc 14 about axis 22. a cover 24 covers a portion of actuator 18. drive controller 26 is coupled to actuator 18. in the preferred embodiment, drive controller 26 is either mountable within disc drive 10, or is located outside of disc drive 10 with suitable connection to actuator 18. actuator 18, includes an actuator arm assembly 28, a rigid support member 30, and a head gimbal assembly 32. head gimbal assembly 32 includes a load beam or flexure arm 34 coupled to rigid member 30, and a hydrodynamic air bearing ( a slider ) 36 coupled by a gimbal ( not shown ) to load beam 34. slider 36 supports a magnetoresistive transducer for reading information from disc 12 and encoding information on disc 12. during operation, drive controller 26 receives position information indicating a portion of disc 12 to be accessed. drive controller 26 receives the position information from an operator, from a host computer, or from another suitable controller. based on the position information, drive controller 26 provides a position signal to actuator 18. the position signal causes actuator 18 to pivot about axis 22. this, in turn, causes actuator 18 to pivot about axis 22. this, in turn, causes slider 36 ( and consequently the transducer mounted on slider 36 ) to move radially over the surface of disc 12 in a generally arcuaic path indicated by arrow 38. drive controller 26 and actuator 18 operate in a known closed loop, negative feedback manner so that the transducer carried by slider 36 is positioned over the desired portion of disc 12. once the transducer is appropriately positioned, drive controller 26 then executes a desired read or write operation. fig2 is a cross - section of elements of a magnetoresistive transducer 56 which is carried on slider 36. a layer of oxide, preferably aluminum oxide 62 is deposited upon a soft - magnetic substrate 60, preferably nizn. next, the magnetoresistive sensor material 64 is deposited in a magnetic field and patterned. ( exchange biasing material may then be deposited and patterned if desired ). metal contacts 66 are then deposited on the magnetoresistive strip 64. a second layer of oxide 68 is then deposited. these two oxide layers, 62 and 68, comprise the read gap. a layer of polyimide or photo resist 70 is then deposited and patterned as shown to remove the layer adjacent the gap end of the head. next a layer of ferromagnetic material 70 is laid down, preferably nife ( permalloy ). this layer 72 comprises the trailing pole / shield. next, a write gap oxide, 75 ( aluminum oxide or silicon dioxide ), is deposited followed by a second layer of polyimide or photo resist 74. metal coils 78 are deposited and patterned. two layers of polyamide or photoresist 76 are deposited and patterned to remove the portion not adjacent the coils 78. and finally, a final layer of a ferromagnetic material is deposited to form top inductive write head pole 79 and encompass the coils and contact the other ferromagnetic layer bottom inductive write pole and shared shield 72 to form an inductive write head 58. preferably, shield 72 is formed of permalloy. fig3 is an end view of elements of the transducer 56 of fig2. spacing layers are omitted for clarity. shown in the figure are the ferrite substrate 60, the magnetoresistive strip 64, its lateral metal contacts 66 defining a central sensor active region 65 of length l, and the ferromagnetic trailing pole / shield 72, and the leading pole 79. the length of the leading pole 79 defines the written track width via magnetic mirroring with the trailing pole / shield as shown in the figure. this length corresponds to the length l ( plus a processing guard band wherein the length l is intentionally made smaller than the written track width to avoid possible cross talk ) of the central region 65 of the magnetoresistive strip 64, typically, the magnetoresistive strip is longer than a track width to assist in providing a stable central region single domain. it is essential that the trailing pole / shield 72 be as long as the magnetoresistive sensor 64 to completely shield it from side fringing fields originating during the writing process. this makes the lead and trailing poles 79, 72 of different lengths. but it has been discovered that this does not affect the written track width, which is defined by the length of the leading pole 79 and the above mentioned mirroring effects. one aspect of the present invention includes the recognition that domain walls formed in the shields of magnetoresistive ( mr ) sensors can interact with the mr sensor itself. these shield domain walls are mobile under the influence of the media field and stray fields and can cause the formation of moving magnetic artifacts in the sensor. this can cause instability in the mr sensor and is particularly severe where barkhausen noise is present in the shield. the creation of a tightly designed shield domain configuration where the shield shape keeps domain walls away from the sensor region by demagnetizing forces can overcome this affect. however, mr shared poles have a requirement to function both as an upper reader shield and as a bottom writer pole. achievement of a domain configuration in the shared pole suitable for stability and also meeting the requirements of the writer to link to the top pole at the back via requires a compromise. kerr analysis has revealed that for a number of potential shared pole materials, a conventional notching scheme is not sufficient to give the domain state required. for conventional notching, the foremost domain wall is attracted towards the front of the notch ( see fig4 ) and can affect the sensor. this result forms an imbalance in the demagnetizing force on the domain walls at the front and back of the notch. to withdraw this foremost domain wall from the sensitive sensor region, it is possible to compensate for the leading edge demagnetization forces by creating indentations at the rear of the notch protrusion giving a more equalized demagnetization force from the front to the back of the notch ( see fig5 ). fig4 shows a prior art bottom inductive write pole and shared shield 100. shield 100 includes pole tip region 102 and body region 104. pole tip region 102 is positioned over magnetoresistive sensor active region 65, shown in fig4 projected onto pole tip region 102. body region 104 is typically large relative to pole tip region 102 for attachment to the top pole at the back via and to support coil conductors 78. however, pole tip region 102 should be relatively small to focus the magnetic field emanating therefrom for higher density writing of magnetically encoded information. one aspect of the present invention includes the recognition that the prior art design of shield 100 the magnetic domain structure is unstable and thereby may, following a read / write operation, switch directions and introduce noise. referring to fig4 note that the closure domains 106 and 108 have differing sizes such that middle domain 110 has two sidewalls at its closure domains of differing sizes. in this prior art design, the front domain wall is attracted toward the front notch and this can effect the sensor element. this results from an imbalance in the demagnetizing force on the domain walls at the front and back of the notch. fig5 is a top plan view of shield 72 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. shield 72 includes pole tip region 120 and body region 122 separated by a notch 124. note that proper placement of the notch shifts domain wall 126 away from sensor active region 65 and causes the closure domains 128 and 130 to have substantially equal side walls whereby the middle domain region 132 has symmetrical closure domain side walls. notch 124 provides a more equalized demagnetization force from the front to the back of the notch. this reduces the effects of noise, such as barkhausen noise, on sensor region 65 shown in fig5 projected onto pole tip region 120, thereby providing improved readback characteristics and a transducing element capable of higher density recording. further, this still provides the body region 122 for coupling to the top pole piece and for supporting and coupling to the coil structure. fig6 is a top plan view of a multi - channel shield 140 in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. multi - channel shield 140 includes a plurality of individual shields labelled 72a, 72b and 72c. each shield is formed by respective pole tip regions 120a, 120b and 120c coupled to body region 122. similar elements have retained their numbering with fig6 for simplicity. the embodiment of fig6 is particularly well suited for a multi - channel tape head in which multiple tape channels are accessed simultaneously. further, the structure allows a common shared pole while ensuring individual sensor stability. during manufacture, only one of the structures needs to be probed to determined isolation from the magnetoresistive sensor. this is contrast to the necessity of probing each individual head in prior art designs. further, the large shared pole provides improved thermal dissipation and thereby reduces heat build up in the head. although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. for example, in one aspect of the invention other configurations or techniques may be employed to achieve the desired domain structure.",a transducer in a magnetic storage device includes an elongated magnetoresistive element having an active region . first and second electrical contacts couple to the elongated magnetoresistive element on opposite sides of the active region . a bottom inductive write pole and shared shield is positioned adjacent the elongated magnetoresistive element and

signal electrodes 32. on the glass substrate 31 a, transparent pixel electrodes 34, formed from ito or the like, are arranged in correspondence to the tfts 31 t. one of the pixel electrodes 34 is selected by the scanning signal from one of the scanning electrodes 33 related to the tft 31 t corresponding to the one of the pixel electrodes 34, and the video signal from the corresponding signal electrode 32 drives the selected ito pixel electrode 34 to operate. the liquid crystal layer 31 may be made by using a liquid crystal having a negative anisotropy of the dielectric constant provided by merck ltd. the aforesaid molecule alignment film may be made by using a vertical alignment film provided by jsr corp. typically, a spacer as illustrated in fig1 b is used to assembly the glass substrate 31 a and the glass substrate 31 b so that the thickness of the liquid crystal layer 31 is maintained to be about 4 m. in the liquid crystal display device 40, in the un - driven state, that is, when the driving voltage is not applied to the transparent pixel electrodes 34, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned to be substantially perpendicular to the plane of the liquid crystal layer 31, and due to the polarizer 31 a and the analyzer 31 b, the liquid crystal display device 40 is in black display state. in the driven state, that is, when the driving voltage is applied to the transparent pixel electrodes 34, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned to be substantially parallel to the liquid crystal layer 31, the liquid crystal display device 40 is in white display state. as illustrated in fig1 b, the scanning electrodes 33, which also act as gate electrodes of the tfts 31 t, extend on the glass substrate 31 a, and a gate insulating film 33 a is deposited on the glass substrate 31 a to cover the scanning electrodes 33. also not illustrated, an interlayer insulating film 33 b is deposited on the gate insulating film 33 a to cover an amorphous silicon layer or a poly - silicon layer constituting the tfts 31 t, and the signal electrodes 32 are arranged on the interlayer insulating film 33 b. further, another interlayer insulating film 33 c is deposited on the interlayer insulating film 33 b to cover the signal electrodes 32. the transparent pixel electrodes 34 are formed on the interlayer insulating film 33 c and are connected to the tfts 31 t through not - illustrated via holes. moreover, a molecule alignment film corresponding to the molecule alignment film 25 ma in fig4 is formed on the interlayer insulating film 33 c to cover the transparent pixel electrodes 34. in the liquid crystal display device 40, cutouts 34 a, which correspond to the structure 13 a in fig1 a and fig1 b, are formed in a zigzag manner in a portion of the transparent pixel electrodes 34. it should be noted that the structures 13 a and 13 b can be replaced by depressed patterns formed in the substrate 11 a or 11 b. on the other hand, on the glass substrate 31 b, a black mask ( bm ) is formed in correspondence to the tfts 31 t, and red ( r ), green ( g ), and blue ( b ) color filters 31 f are arranged in correspondence to the transparent pixel electrodes 34. an electrode 36, which corresponds to the electrode layer 23 b in fig2 a, are uniformly formed on the color filters 31 f, and a projecting pattern 38 and a columnar spacer 39, which correspond to the structure 25 b in fig4, are formed on the electrode 36 by depositing resist patterns. the projecting pattern 38 and the columnar spacer 39 are covered by molecule alignment films 37, which correspond to the molecule alignment films 25 ma in fig2 a. both the projecting pattern 38 and the columnar spacer 39 have smooth inclined surfaces and projecting ends. the columnar spacer 39 is higher than the projecting pattern 38, for example, it is fabricated to have a height of four m corresponding to the thickness of the liquid crystal cells. the end of the columnar spacer 39 is in contact with the transparent pixel electrodes 34 through the molecule alignment films 35 and 37, and thereby, defining the thickness of the liquid crystal layer 31. in order to form the projecting pattern 38 and the columnar spacer 39, for example, a resist film may be deposited on the glass substrate 31 b to a desired thickness by, for example, spin coating, and after being patterned, the resist film may be heated and cured twice with different film thicknesses. in this way, the projecting pattern 38 and the columnar spacer 39 can be fabricated easily. for example, the projecting pattern 38 is formed by using a positive resist, and the aforementioned depressed pattern 39 is formed by using a negative resist. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a structure of the pixel electrode 34 of the liquid crystal display device 40 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. as illustrated in fig1, the projecting pattern 38 and the cutouts 34 a are formed to extend on the pixel electrode 34 in a zigzag manner and in parallel to each other. the pixel electrode 34 is divided into an upper domain region and a lower domain region by the electrode pattern 31 c, which extends in the horizontal direction through the center portion, and produces the auxiliary capacitance cs. the electrode pattern 31 c corresponds to the electrode pattern 23 c in fig4. hence, the projecting pattern 38 and the cutouts 34 a extend in parallel to a certain direction ( referred to as first direction where necessary ) in both the first domain and the second domain, but the first direction in the upper domain perpendicularly intersects with the first direction in the lower domain. therefore, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the upper domain is perpendicular to the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the lower domain, and this reduces dependence of optical display on an azimuthal angle or a polar angle. in the configuration shown in fig1, each columnar spacer 39 partially overlaps with the upper end and lower end of the transparent pixel electrode 34 on the scanning electrodes ( gate bus line ) 33. due to such a configuration, near a corner of the transparent pixel electrode 34, the liquid crystal molecules receive interactions from the edge of the transparent pixel electrode 34, the cutouts 34 a, and the columnar spacer 39. however, as illustrated in fig1, the columnar spacer 39 is arranged to face the projecting pattern 38 with the cutouts 34 a in between, the columnar spacer 39 enhances interaction of the cutouts 34 a from the back side of the cutouts 34 a, the liquid crystal molecules are tilted to be substantially perpendicular to the extending direction of the cutouts 34 a. under this condition, if the transparent pixel electrode 34 is driven through the tft 31 t, at the corner of the transparent pixel electrode 34, the liquid crystal molecules are rapidly tilted to the direction substantially perpendicular to the extending direction of the cutouts 34 a. thereby, it is possible to realize a liquid crystal display device capable of high speed display with high transmittance in the driven state. according to experimental results by the present inventors, it was found that due to the configuration shown in fig1, the transmittance was improved by 6 % compared with the configuration shown in fig8. each pixel was investigated by using a microscope, and no abnormal domain is observed near the columnar spacer 39. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 50 according to a second embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. as illustrated in fig1, the projecting pattern 38 and the cutouts 34 a are formed to extend on the pixel electrode 34 in a zigzag manner and in parallel to each other. in the second embodiment, the cutout pattern 34 a is formed only at the center portion of the pixel electrode 34, but not arranged outside the center portion, specifically, not arranged outside the projecting pattern 38. due to this arrangement, the constraint on the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a applied by the projecting pattern 38 is in effect even up to the outer edge of the pixel electrode 34. in the second embodiment, similarly, the columnar spacers 39 are also formed on the scanning electrodes 33, but if the columnar spacers 39 were also arranged to partially overlap with the transparent pixel electrode 34, as in shown in fig1, because there is not any cutout 34 a between the columnar spacers 39 and the transparent pixel electrode 34, the columnar spacers 39 would also regulate the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a, and this produces an effect in confliction with the alignment regulation effect of the projecting pattern 38, and causes disorder of the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a. in order to avoid this problem, as illustrated in fig1, the columnar spacers 39 are separated from the transparent pixel electrode 34 by a distance px. experimental results showed that the transmittance in the driven state was improved by about 3 % compared with the configuration shown in fig8 when the distance px was set to be about 6 m. this implies that by separating the columnar spacers 39 from the transparent pixel electrode 34 by a distance px, for example, setting the distance px to be about 6 m, the alignment regulation effect of the columnar spacers 39 essentially becomes negligible. the configuration shown in fig1 is basically the same as that shown in fig1 except for the features described above. in addition, in order to illustrate the columnar spacers 39 arranged outside the pixel region, the sizes of the columnar spacers 39 are reduced more or less in fig1, and for this reason, the arrangement outside the projecting pattern 38 in fig1 is illustrated in fig1. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 60 according to a third embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. as illustrated in fig1, in the present embodiment, in addition to the structure shown in fig1 or fig1, the columnar spacer 39 is arranged such that the cutout patterns 34 a are formed between two projecting patterns 38 opposite to each other on the electrode pattern 31 c, which produces the auxiliary capacitance cs, and the edges of the columnar spacer 39 are in parallel to the cutout patterns 34 a. in the structure in fig1, between the columnar spacer 39 and the projecting pattern 38, the columnar spacer 39, the projecting pattern 38, and the cutout patterns 34 a cooperate with each other so as to regulate the alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules to be substantially perpendicular to the extending direction of the cutouts 34 a. hence, when the driving voltage is applied to the transparent pixel electrode 34, the liquid crystal molecules are rapidly tilted to the extending direction of the transparent pixel electrode 34 and the cutouts 34 a to change transmittance of pixels. as described above, in the present embodiment, with the cutout patterns 34 a in between, the columnar spacer 39 provides the same effect as the projecting pattern 38 to effectively regulate alignment of the liquid crystal molecules. in the present embodiment, it is preferable to set the distance between the edge of the columnar spacer 39 and the cutout patterns 34 a to be substantially the same as the distance between the projecting pattern 38 and the cutout patterns 34 a. in the present embodiment, although the columnar spacer 39 is formed within the pixel region of the transparent pixel electrode 34, a larger portion of the columnar spacer 39 is arranged on the bus electrode 31 c, and this enables a minimum reduction of the transmittance due to presence of the columnar spacer 39, while ensuring a sufficiently large area for realizing the functions of a spacer. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 60 according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those in fig1, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. as illustrated in fig1, in the present embodiment, similar to the structure in fig1 or fig1, a projecting pattern 38 is formed in a shape of l on the inner side of the l - shaped cutout patterns 34 a, in addition, the columnar spacer 39 is arranged on the inner side of the l - shaped projecting patterns 38. in the structure shown in fig1, the alignment regulation effect of the columnar spacers 39 on the liquid crystal molecules 22 a is in confliction with the alignment regulation effect of the projecting pattern 38 on the outer side, however, as illustrated in fig1, the columnar spacer 39 is arranged to be enclosed on three sides by the projecting pattern 38 so as to reduce influence of the columnar spacer 39 on the liquid crystal molecules 22 a. with the structure shown in fig1, an optical transmittance is obtained that is similar to that obtained by using the structure shown in fig1. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 80 according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. in the present embodiment, as illustrated in fig1, in the structure shown in fig1, the projecting patterns 38 are replaced by the columnar spacer 39. hence, in the present embodiment, the columnar spacer 39 is not an isolated pattern, but a continuing pattern. with the structure shown in fig1, that is, by replacing the projecting patterns 38 with the columnar spacer 39, it is possible to realize substantially ideal alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 90 according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. in the present embodiment, as illustrated in fig1, the projecting patterns 38 originally arranged at corners of the pixel electrode 34 are replaced by spacer patterns 39 a having edges in parallel to the extending direction of a cutout patterns 34 a facing the otherwise existing projecting patterns 38. in addition, on the auxiliary capacitance bus 31 c at the center portion, a spacer pattern 39 b having a circular cross section is arranged on the inner side of the l - shaped cutout pattern 34 a, in other words, the spacer pattern 39 b is arranged to face the l - shaped projecting pattern 38 with the cutout patterns 34 a in between. in the present embodiment, by arranging the spacer patterns 39 a to be at the corners of the pixel electrode 34 with the edges of the spacer patterns 39 a being in parallel to the extending direction of the cutout patterns 34 a facing the spacer patterns 39 a, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a at the corners of the pixel electrode 34 is regulated to be perpendicular to edges of the spacer patterns 39 a, and this suppress occurrence of display defects. by arranging the spacer pattern 39 b on the inner side of the l - shaped cutout pattern 34 a, it is found that desired alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a is attained even in this region. concerning the spacer pattern 39 b, although it is thought that preferably the spacer pattern 39 b may be the triangular spacer pattern as illustrated in fig1, in the present embodiment illustrated in fig1, the spacer pattern 39 b is not limited to the triangular spacer pattern illustrated in fig1. in the present embodiment, by arranging the spacer patterns 39 a to be at the corners of the pixel electrode 34, or by arranging the spacer pattern 39 a to have a triangular cross section, the tft glass substrate 31 a and the tft glass substrate 31 b can be stably supported. fig1 is a plan view illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 100 according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention. in fig1, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. in the present embodiment, as illustrated in fig1, the spacer pattern 39 a correspond to a combination of the columnar spacer 39 in fig1 and a feature of the spacer pattern 39 a in fig1, that is, the spacer pattern 39 a in fig1 has an edge in parallel to the extending direction of the cutout pattern 34 a. namely, in the present embodiment, the spacer pattern 39 a extends over a large area from outside of the pixel region and covers a portion of the pixel electrode 34, and due to this, the tft glass substrate 31 a and the tft glass substrate 31 b are stably supported by the spacer pattern 39 a. in this situation, because the spacer pattern 39 a has an edge in parallel to the extending direction of the cutout pattern 34 a facing itself, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a is regulated to be perpendicular to the extending direction of the cutout pattern 34 a, and this reduces disorder of alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a in the pixel regions. thereby, the liquid crystal display device 100 has good transmittance in the driven state. fig1 a through 18c are plan view and cross - sectional views illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device 110 according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. in fig1 a through 18c, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those described previously, and overlapping descriptions are omitted. as illustrated in fig1 a through 18c, the spacer patterns 39 a and 39 b in the present embodiment correspond to a combination of the columnar spacer 39 in fig1 and the columnar spacer 39 b in fig1. the columnar spacer 39 a as shown in fig1, which acts as a main spacer pattern in the present embodiment, and the columnar spacer 39 b as shown in fig1, which acts as a sub spacer pattern in the present embodiment, are obtained by patterning the same resist film deposited on the tft glass substrate 31 b, and have the same height. nevertheless, the main spacer 39 a is arranged in the pixel region on the glass substrate 31 b to face a portion of the tft glass substrate 31 a including a stacked structure of the pixel electrode 34, an intermediate electrode 41, a cs electrode 31 c, and interlayer insulating films 42, and as illustrated in fig1 b, the end of the columnar spacer 39 a is in contact with the glass substrate 31 a. on the other hand, the sub spacer 39 b is arranged in the pixel region on the glass substrate 31 b to face a portion of the tft glass substrate 31 a including a stacked structure of the scanning electrode 33 and interlayer insulating films 42, as illustrated in fig1 c. thus, there is a gap g, for example, equaling to about 0. 2 m, between the sub spacer 39 b and the glass substrate 31 a, corresponding to the thicknesses of the pixel electrode 34 and the intermediate electrode 41. in fig1 b and fig1 c, illustration of molecule alignment films and other elements are omitted. because there is a gap g between the sub spacer 39 b and the glass substrate 31 a, when an external force is applied to the glass substrate 31 a and the glass substrate 31 b in the liquid crystal display device 110, the liquid crystal panel is bendable, and this can prevent permanent deformation in the columnar spacer, or other damages to the columnar spacer. even in the above configuration, the alignment regulation effect applied by the columnar spacer 39 a on the liquid crystal molecules 22 a is eliminated by forming the projecting pattern 38 to enclose the columnar spacer 39 a on three sides, thereby, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a is regulated by the projecting pattern 38 and the cutout pattern 34 a. in addition, by separating the sub columnar spacer 39 b from the transparent pixel electrode 34 by a distance px, the sub spacer 39 b essentially does not cause disorder of alignment of the liquid crystal molecules 22 a. further, in the above first through eighth embodiments, fine patterns corresponding to the fine structure patterns 24 illustrated in fig4 may be arranged on the transparent pixel electrode 34 while being perpendicular to the cutout 34 a. while the invention is described above with reference to specific embodiments chosen for purpose of illustration, it should be apparent that the invention is not limited to these embodiments, but numerous modifications could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the basic concept and scope of the invention.","a liquid crystal display device is disclosed that is capable of suppressing disorder of

"birefringent or polarization filters are described in optical waves in crystals, yeh and yariv, referenced above. the transmission through a birefringent element sandwiched between parallel polarizers is periodic in frequency and is given by : i ( ) : = [ cos [ ( n e - n 0 ) l 10 6 ] ] 2 eqn. 1 where i is the intensity, is the wavelength in nanometers, n e is the extraordinary index of refraction, n o is the ordinary index of refraction and l is the thickness of the crystal in mm. the crystal is oriented with its optic axis at 45 degrees to the input polarization. note that in this governing relationship the transmission is periodic in optical frequency ( i. e. inverse wavelength ) and the transmission is lossless at the peak. the present systems use this fundamental controlling eqn. 1 together with a number of others in providing shaped transmissivity characteristics with low insertion loss, polarization insensitivity and compensation for temperature variation. fig1 to 4 depict the arrangement and relationships of the components of a 1 2 passband flattened and temperature compensated interleaving filter 10, the components of which are seated on a generally planar surface 13 of a stainless steel optical bench 12 ( see fig2 and 3 ). the optical bench 12 ( which alternatively can be of other materials such as silicon ) contains shaped recesses 14 formed by electron discharge machining ( edm ), in which recesses 14 in the planar surface 13 the polarizing components and crystals are mounted and precisely aligned and angled. a gradient index ( grin ) lens responsive to the wideband input stream from an optical fiber is a collimator 16 for the wdm channel stream. the collimator lens 16 is secured within a cylindrical metal housing 20 which is welded within a stainless steel clip 22 of general u - shape, where base legs 24, 25 are welded to the optical bench 12. the clip 22 design allows for precise and stable tilt and translation adjustment of the collimator lens during assembly. after collimation, the input beam is transmitted through a beam displacing polarizer 28, here of yvo4 crystal, which splits the input beam into two parallel beams ( fig4 particularly ) with crossed polarizations that are shifted 1 mm with respect to the other. splitting the input beam into separate polarizations and then recombining after filtering results in a polarization independent device. the two beams are then incident on a first birefringent crystal stage comprised of a yttrium orthovanadate ( yvo4 ) crystal 30 and a lithium niobate ( linbo 3 crystal, 32 configured to form a first a temperature compensated pair. there are a number of different birefringent materials which can be used for temperature compensation, including yvo4 and linbo3. yvo4 has high birefringence, n = 0. 2039 at 1550 nm, and is readably available commercially. linbo3 has a large thermooptic coefficient opposite in sign to yvo4 and is also readably available commercially. the required length ratio for temperature compensation of yvo4 to linbo3 is 6. 60 : 1. the lengths scale inversely with channel spacing, and 50 ghz and 25 ghz spacing are achievable. the optical ( c ) axis of the yvo4 crystal and the linbo3 crystal 32 are oriented at 45 relative to the input polarizer 28. for a 100 ghz to 200 ghz channel spacing the yvo4 crystal 30 is 7. 370 mm long and the lithium niobate crystal 32 is 1. 116 mm long. the second stage, which is also temperature compensated but employed to flatten the peak of maximum transmissivity of the passband is comprised of another set of yvo4 36 and lithium niobate crystals 38. the lengths of each of these are twice that of the like crystals used in the first stage. the optical axes of each separate crystal 36, 38 of the second pair are oriented along a crystal edge and the crystals are tilted 14. 8 degrees with respect to the top surface 13 of the optical bench 13. the edges of the lithium niobate crystals 32 and 38 are electrically shorted with a conductive coating 40 such as silver epoxy which conducts away charges built up due to the pyroelectric property of linbo 3. such electric charges would otherwise tend to build up on the surface of crystals 32, 38 as the temperature is cycled, and the result could be uncontrolled hysteresis of the index of refraction. such charges must be eliminated for linbo 3 to be used as a temperature compensating element. conductive silver epoxy 40 ( or metallization or anti static liquid ) of the + / c faces of a crystal electrically shorts the crystal and dissipates charges. dopants such as mgo which reduce the electrical conductivity would also reduce the pyroelectric effects. the two beams after being transmitted through the birefringent crystals 30, 32, 36, 38 are incident on another yvo4 beam displacing polarizer 41. each input beam is split up into two beams with different polarizations, as best seen in fig4. two of the beams with crossed polarization overlap and are coupled directly into one of two output grin lens collimators 47, 48. the two other beams are combined in part by using a single prism 42 to direct the s polarized beam to one side of a polarizing beam splitter cube, 43 with the p polarized beam being redirected off a pair of prisms 44, 45 to an orthogonal side of the beam splitter cube 43. the path lengths of the two combined beams are matched to better than 1 mm in order to minimize polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ). the resulting overlapping beams are then coupled into the second output collimator 48. the output collimators 47, 48 are laser welded to clips which are in turn laser welded to the optical bench 12. referring specifically to fig2 the optical bench 12 is mounted inside a tray 50 with a fiber feedthrough 52 in the end wall 54 receiving an input optical fiber 18 in line with the input collimator 16. although the output side is not shown in this view it differs in having only pairs of elements for delivering the two output beams. the bench 12 is attached to the base of the tray 50 with rtv adhesive or, as shown, a silicone sheet 58 can be used to provide cushioning from shock and vibration. the input fiber 18 and two output fibers are fed through the fiber feedthroughs and sealed with epoxy. a lid 58 is attached to the body of the tray 50 and the waist is sealed with epoxy in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. all of the optical surfaces, including the crystals, are antireflection coated to minimize optical loss. the experimentally measured transmission ( using an led and an optical spectrum analyzer ) of a fiber coupled, passband flattened 100 ghz interleaver is shown in fig5. the unit uses two stages of lithium niobate and yvo4 crystals. this measured response is charted in fig5. the spacing between transmissivity peaks is that of a 100 ghz channel spacing to 200 ghz channel spacing interleaving filter. wider passband flatness in a filter ( i. e. a broadening of the width of the transmissivity peaks ), prevents narrowing of the transmission spectra when filters are cascaded and reduces the required wavelength accuracy of the wdm source lasers. it also improves system performance by reducing the attenuation of the information content of a modulated signal. by adding additional birefringent elements, the passband of the interleaving filter is flattened to a selectable degree. as shown in fig6 which depicts response variations between one, two and three crystals in series, the passband of a single element birefringent filter is 0. 35 nm wide at the 0. 5 db bandwidth by adding a second and third birefringent element, shown by dotted and dashed lines respectively, the maximum is progressively broadened. the first element is of length l and oriented with its c axis at 45 degrees. for a series of two, the second element is of length 2 l and has an orientation of 14. 8 degrees, substantially widening the amplitude at maximum without broadening the cutoff point. addition of a third element of length 2 l and orientation = + 10 degrees broadens the maximum even further, but introduces intermediate dips of minor magnitude. for a 100 ghz / 200 ghz interleaver the bandwidth for a passband flatness of 0. 5 db is 0. 35 nm for the single stage, 0. 47 nm for the two stage, and 0. 60 nm for the three stage design. even better flatness can be achieved by adding more elements ; however, this comes at the expense of additional cost and insertion loss. although the curves depict the results of measurements with crystals of only one type, they are equally valid for temperature compensated combinations using different crystal types. the polarization dependent loss ( pdl ) of the interleaving filter must be minimized to a value below 0. 1 db. this is achieved during coupling of the two crossed polarization beams incident on each output grin lens collimator 46 or 48. in order to minimize pdl the beams must be coupled into the output fiber with the same efficiency. this is not necessarily at the peak coupling efficiency of each beam. this can be determined by varying or switching the input polarization to the interleaving filter 10 until no variation of power on the output fibers is measured. in order to make a polarization independent fiber based interleaving filter, the signal is split up into two beams using the lossless beam displacing polarizer 28. the two beams are transmitted through the birefringent elements 30, 32, 36, 38 and recombined into two outputs using the additional lossless beam displacing polarizer 42. the s polarized output of one of the beams is recombined with the p polarization of the other beam. every other channel of a wdm stream is thus separated into one of the two output collimators 47, 48 and the output fibers to which they couple. devices typically operate over a 0 - 70 c. temperature range and should be passively temperature compensated. for a 100 ghz filter response the center wavelength drift should typically be less than + / 0. 0015 nm / c. the use of different crystals with opposite signs of the birefringence or thermooptic coefficient in the manner described achieves this result. the retardance of two crystals in series is given by : 1 + 2 : = 2 ( l 1 n 1 + l 2 n 2 ) where is the phase retardance, l is the length of each crystal, and the birefringence is given by n 1 = n e, 1 n o, 1 for the first crystal. for the second crystal n 2 = n e n o if the crystal axis is parallel to that of the first crystal and is n 2 = n o n e if it is rotated 90 degrees. the change of retardance with temperature is given by : ( 1 + 2 ) t : = ( 2 ) ( l 1 ( n 1 ) t + l 2 ( n 2 ) t + l 1 1 n 1 + l 2 2 n 2 ) where is the thermal expansion coefficient. the condition for compensation is given by : l 1 l 2 : = - ( ( n 1 ) t + 1 n 1 ) ( ( n 2 ) t + 2 n 2 ) usually the thermal expansion coefficient term can be neglected. with the optic axis of the crystals in alignment, compensation is achieved using two crystals with different signs of the thermooptic coefficient. if the crystals are rotated 90 degrees with respect to each other, materials can be used with the same sign of the thermooptic coefficient. during assembly, both the frequency period and absolute wavelength of the peaks must be adjusted. this can be controlled by tight tolerances of the thickness of the polished crystals. the crystals or the input beam angle can also be tilted to adjust the wavelength. another approach is to polish the crystal to form a slight wedge shape, with the beam - incident faces thus being non - orthogonal to beam direction. then the wavelength and period can be adjusted by translating the beam on the crystal. in order for both the parallel beams to see the same thickness of crystal, the wedge angle should be transverse to the plane of the two incident beams. two crystals with opposing wedges can be translated relative to each other to adjust the thickness and minimize any beam steering. another approach to tune the wavelength is to choose from a set of linbo3 crystals at slightly different thickness, and tuning by substituting for the best response. a spacing of 10 microns can allow for tuning while only slightly changing the temperature compensation condition. adjustment of the absolute wavelength peaks of the filter can also be achieved by using a zero order half wave plate after each of the stages. by rotating the waveplates additional birefringence is introduced which tunes the filter. zero order waveplates are used to minimize temperature dependence of the waveplate. the alignment and tolerance of the optical components are critical. both insertion loss and manufacturing assembly cost need to be minimized. an alternative to the stainless steel optical bench is to use a silicon bench as a platform to mount all of the components. precise v - grooves are etched onto the silicon substrate and components are dropped into them and attached with epoxy. 1 2 interleavers can be cascaded to split every nth channel into one of n output fibers. for the second stage a crystal of half the thickness of the first stage is required. in general the transmission through an n stage interleaver will have a transmittance at one of the output fibers given by : i ( ) : = i = 1 n n [ cos [ ( n e - n 0 ) l i 10 6 ] ] 2 4 the other fibers will have the same wavelength dependent transmittance with the peaks shifted by a multiple of the input channel spacing. each stage of a birefringent filter is not limited to separating every other channel. more generally a single stage can group every nth channel onto a single fiber and the remaining ( n 1 ) adjacent channels in each period onto a separate fiber. one approach is to use a solc type filter described in the yeh and yariv treatise referred to above. there are two designs, folded and fanned, which rely on a stack of rotated birefringent plates of equal thickness. another example of an arrangement in accordance with the invention, referring now to fig7 divides the input beam from an input collimater 60 into an s polarized beam and an orthogonal p polarized beam at a first beam splitting polarizer cube 62. the p polarized beam is directed back into parallelism for compactness at a prism 63, and both beams then pass separately through sheet polarizers 64, 65 to temperature compensating birefringent crystal pairs 70, 71 and 73, 74 as described above, after which separate beam pairs are recombined. s polarized components are angled off a prism 80 to one face of a second polarizer cube 82, which receives the p polarized beam at another face. from the second cube 82 two orthogonal beams merge, each combining s and p components, and the two combined beams are directed to first and second collimators 84, 85 respectively. this arrangement simplifies beam recombination but, because of the characteristics of polarizing beam splitters, the cross - talk between adjacent channels is higher, even though reduced somewhat by the sheet polarizers. in addition, the costs of using separate crystals of equal lengths must be considered. other examples of arrangements in accordance with the invention, referring to fig8 and fig9 make use of different optical arrangements to recombine the s and p polarized beams into the second output fiber. in fig8 the optical layout from the input collimator through the birefringent crystals and the second beam displacing polarizer is the same as described previously. here, however, a prism 90 is used to pick off the center beam emerging from the second beam displacer 41 which contains both required polarizations. this beam is reflected with another prism 92 and coupled directly into an output collimator 47. the other two beams emerging from the second beam displacer 41 are recombined within a third beam displacing polarizer 94. the length of the last beam displacer 90 is twice that of the first two 28, 41 due to the need for twice the displacement. since the path lengths of the two beams would not otherwise be matched, a compensating plate 96 is inserted in one of the beam paths to match the optical path length. a high index material such as lithium niobate, with the crystal axis aligned with the input polarization, is used in the s polarized beam. another approach to match the optical path lengths is shown in fig9. the two beams emerging from the second beam displacer 41 are transmitted through a half wave plate 98 and then recombined using a third beam displacement polarizer 100. the half wave plate 98 rotates the polarization 90 degrees, which ensures that the overall path lengths of the two beams are matched after going through the final beam displacer 100. the half wave plate 98 is a zero order design to reduce the temperature dependence. the combined beams in the midregion of the second beam displacing polarizer 41 are angled off a common prism 102 to the second output collimator 48. although a number of variants and alternatives have been described, the invention is not limited thereto but emcompasses all forms and modifications within the scope of the appended claims.","an optical signal filter for providing a periodic transfer function in transmitting signals within a selected bandwidth , by which passbands are interleavered into groups of

"section 1 overview : this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we review the related work on both k nn and time - dependent shortest path studies. in section 3, we formally define the td - k nn query in spatial networks. in section 4, we establish the theoretical foundation of our algorithms and explain our query processing technique. in section 5, we present experimental results on variety of networks with actual time - dependent travel - times generated from real - world traffic data ( collected for past 1. 5 years ). in section 6, we conclude and discuss our future work. section 2 related work : in this section we review previous studies on k nn query processing in road networks as well as time - dependent shortest path computation. section 2. 1 k nn queries in spatial networks : in query processing in spatial networks ( proceedings of vldb, pages 802 - 813, berlin, germany, 2003 ), papadias et al. introduced incremental network expansion ( ine ) and incremental euclidean restriction ( ier ) methods to support k nn queries in spatial networks. while ine is an adaption of the dijkstra algorithm, ier exploits the euclidean restriction principle in which the results are first computed in euclidean space and then refined by using the network distance. in voronoi - based k nn search in spatial networks ( proceedings of vldb, pages 840 - 851, toronto, canada, 2004 ), kolandouzan and shahabi proposed first degree network voronoi diagrams to partition the spatial network to network voronoi polygons ( nvp ), one for each data object. they indexed the nvps with a spatial access method to reduce the problem to a point location problem in euclidean space. cho et al., in an efficient and scalable approach to cnn queries in a road network ( proceedings of vldb, pages 865 - 876, trondheim, norway, 2005 ), presented a system unicons where the main idea is to integrate the precomputed k nns into the dijkstra algorithm. hu et al., in fast nearest neighbor search on road networks ( proceedings of edbt, pages 33 - 40, toronto, canada, 2006 ), proposed a distance signature approach that precomputes the network distance between each data object and network vertex. the distance signatures are used to find a set of candidate results and dijkstra is employed to compute their exact network distance. huang et al. addressed the k nn problem using island approach in the island approach to nearest neighbor querying in spatial networks ( proceedings of sstd, pages 33 - 40, toronto, canada, 2005 ) where each vertex is associated to all the data points that are in radius r ( so called islands ) covering the vertex. with their approach, they utilized a restricted network expansion from the query point while using the precomputed islands. in scalable network distance browsing in spatial databases ( proceedings of sigmod, pages 33 - 40, toronto, canada, 2008 ), samet et al. proposed a method where they associate a label to each edge that represents all nodes to which a shortest path starts with this particular edge. the labels are used to traverse shortest path quadtrees that enables geometric pruning to find the network distance. with all these studies, the edge weight functions are assumed to be constant and hence the shortest path computations and precomputations are no longer valid with time - varying edge weights. unlike the previous approaches, we make a fundamentally different assumption that the weight of the network edges are time - dependent rather than fixed. section 2. 2 time - dependent shortest path studies : cooke and halsey introduced, in the shortest route through a network with timedependent internodal transit times ( journal of mathematical analysis and applications, nj, usa, 1966 ), the first time - dependent shortest path ( tdsp ) solution where dynamic programming is used over a discretized network. in the discrete - time dynamic shortest path problem : complexity, algorithms, and implementations ( journal of transportation research record, 1645, nj, usa, 1999 ), chabini proposed a discrete time tdsp algorithm that allows waiting at network nodes. in spatia - temporal network databases and routing algorithms : a summary of results ( proceedings of sstd, 2007 ), george and shekhar proposed a time - aggregated graph where they aggregate the travel - times of each edge over the time instants into a time series. all these studies assume the edge weight functions are defined over a finite discrete sequence of time steps t t 0, t 1,. . . , t n. however, discrete - time algorithms can have numerous shortcomings. first, since the entire network is replicated for every specified time step, the discrete - time methods typically require an extensive amount of storage space for real - world scenarios where the spatial network is large. second, these approaches can only provide approximate results since the computations are done on discrete - times rather than in continuous time. in an appraisal of some shortest path algorithms ( journal of operation research 17, ny, usa, 1969 ), dreyfus proposed a generalization of dijkstra algorithm, but his algorithm is showed ( by halpren in shortest route with time dependent length of edges and limited delay possibilities in nodes ; journal of mathematical methods of operations research, 21, 1969 ) to be true only in fifo networks. if the fifo property does not hold in a time - dependent network, then the problem is np - hard as shown in shortest - path and minimum - delay algorithms in networks with time - dependent edge - length ( journal of the acm, 37, 1990 ), where orda and rom proposed a bellman - ford based solution where edge weights are piece - wise linear functions. in finding time - dependent shortest paths over graphs ( proceedings of edbt, new york, n. y., usa, 2008 ), ding et al. used a variation of label - setting algorithm which decouples the path - selection and time - refinement by scanning a sequence of time steps of which the size depends on the values of the arrival time functions. in finding fastest paths on a road network with speed patterns ( proceedings of icde, washington, usa, 2006 ), kanoulas et al. introduced a time - interval all fastest path ( allfp ) algorithm in which they, instead of sorting the priority queue by scalar values, maintain a priority queue of all the paths to be expanded. therefore, they enumerate all the paths from a source to a destination which yields exponential run - time in the worst case. section 3 problem definition : in this section, we formally define the problem of time - dependent k nn search in spatial networks. we assume a road network containing a set of data objects ( i. e., points of interest such as restaurants, hospitals, etc. ) as well as query objects searching for their k nn. we model the road network as a time - dependent weighted graph where the non - negative weights are time - dependent travel - times ( i. e., positive piece - wise linear functions of time ) between the nodes. we assume both data and query objects lie on the network edges and all relevant information about the objects is maintained by a central server. definition 1 : a time - dependent graph ( g t ) is defined as g t ( v, e ) where v and e represent set of nodes and edges, respectively. for every edge e ( v i, v j ), there is a cost function c ( v i, v j ) ( t ) which specifies the cost of traveling from v i to v j at time t. in fig3 a, a road network is modeled as a time - dependent graph g t ( v, e ). while fig3 a shows the graph structure, fig3 b, 3 c, 3 d, 3 e, and 3 f illustrate the time - dependent edge costs, c 1, 2 ( t ), c 2, 3 ( t ), c 2, 4 ( t ), c 4, 5 ( t ), and c 3, 5 ( t ), respectively, as piece - wise linear functions for the corresponding edges. for each edge, we define upper - bound ( max ( c v i, v j ) ) and lower - bound ( min ( c v i, v j ) ) time - independent costs. for example, in fig3 b, min ( c v 1, v 2 ) and max ( c v 1, v 2 ) of edge e ( v 1, v 2 ) are 10 and 20, respectively. definition 2 : let { s = v 1, v 2,. . . , v k = d } represent a path which contains a sequence of nodes where e ( v i, v i 1 ) e and i = 1,. . . , k 1. given a g t, a path ( s d ) from source s to destination d, and a departure - time at the source t s, the time - dependent travel time tt ( s d, t s ) is the time it takes to travel along the path. since the travel - time of an edge varies depending on the arrival - time to that edge ( i. e., arrival dependency ), the travel time is computed as follows : tt ( s d, t s ) = i = 1 k 1 c ( v i, v i + 1 ) ( t i ) where t 1 = t s, t i + 1 = t i + c ( v i, v i + 1 ) ( t i ), i = 1,. . . , k ( 1 ) the upper - bound travel - time itt ( s d ) and the lower - bound travel time ltt ( s d ) are defined as the maximum and minimum possible times to travel along the path, respectively. the upper and lower bound travel time are computed as follows, utt ( s d ) = i = 1 k 1 max ( c v i, v i + 1 ), ltt ( s d ) = i = 1 k 1 min ( c v i, v i + 1 ), i = 1,. . . , k. ( 2 ) to illustrate the above definitions in fig3 a, consider t s = 5 and path ( v 1, v 2, v 3, v 5 ) where tt ( v 1 v 5, 5 ) = 45, utt ( v 1 v 5 ) = 65, and ltt ( v 1 v 5 ) = 35. note that we do not need to consider arrival - dependency when computing utt and ltt hence ; t is not included in their definitions. given the definitions of tt, utt and ltt, the following property holds for any path in g t : ltt ( s d ) tt ( s d, t s ) utt ( s d ). this property is used in subsequent sections to establish some properties of the algorithm. definition 3 : given a g t, s, d, and t s, the time - dependent shortest path tdsp ( s, d, t s ) is a path with the minimum travel - time among all paths from s to d. since the travel - time between nodes can be considered the distance measure, we refer to tdsp ( s, d, t s ) as time - dependent fastest path, tdfp ( s, d, t s ), and use them interchangeably in the rest of the paper. in a g t, the fastest path from s to d is based on the departure - time from s. for instance, in fig3 a, suppose a query is looking for the fastest path from v 1 to v 5 at t s = 5. then, tdfp ( v 1, v 5, 5 ) = { v 1, v 2, v 3, v 5 }. however, the same query at t s = 10 returns tdfp ( v 1, v 5, 10 ) = { v 1, v 2, v 4, v 5 }. as is apparent, with constant edge weights ( i. e., time - independent ), the query would always return the same path as a result. definition 4 : a time - dependent k nearest neighbor query ( td - knn ) is defined as a query that finds the k nearest neighbors of a query object which is moving on a time - dependent network g t. considering a set of n data objects p = { p 1, p 2,. . . , p n }, the td - k nn query with respect to a query point q finds a subset p p of k objects with minimum time - dependent travel - time to q, i. e., for any object p p and p p p, tdfp ( q, p, t ) tdfp ( q, p, t ). note that it can be assumed that g t satisfies the first - in - first - out ( fifo ) property. this property suggests that moving objects exit from an edge in the same order they entered the edge. in practice, many networks, particularly transportation networks, exhibit fifo property. moreover, it can also be assumed that objects do not wait at a node, because, in most real - world applications, waiting at a node is not realistic as it requires the moving object to exit from the route and find a place to park and wait. section 4 td - knn : in this section, we explain an example of a td - k nn algorithm according to the present invention. td - k nn involves two phases : an off - line spatial network indexing phase and an on - line query processing phase. during the off - line phase, the spatial network is partitioned into tight cells ( tc ) and loose cells ( lc ) for each data object p and two complementary indexing schemes tight network index ( tni ) and loose network index ( lni ) are constructed. the main idea behind partitioning the network to tcs and lcs is to localize the k nn search and minimize the costly time - dependent shortest path computation. these index structures enable efficient finding of the data object ( i. e., generator of a tight or loose cell ) that is in shortest time - dependent distance to the query object, q. during the on - line phase, td - k nn finds the first nearest neighbor of q by utilizing the tni and lni constructed in the off - line phase. once the first nearest neighbor is found, td - k nn expands the search area by including the neighbors of the nearest neighbor to find the remaining k 1 data objects. in the following sections, we first introduce some proposed index structures and then describe online query processing algorithm that utilizes these index structures. section 4. 1 indexing time - dependent network ( off - line ) : in this section, we explain the main idea behind tight and loose cells as well as the construction of tight and loose network index structures. tight network index ( tni : the tight cell tc ( p i ) is a sub - network around p i in which any query object is guaranteed to have p i as its nearest neighbor in a time - dependent network. we compute tight cell of a data object by using parallel dijkstra algorithm that grows shortest path trees from each data object. specifically, we expand from p i ( i. e., the generator of the tight cell ) assuming maximum travel - time between the nodes of the network ( i. e., utt ), while in parallel we expand from each and every other data object assuming minimum travel - time between the nodes ( i. e., ltt ). we stop the expansions when the shortest path trees meet. the main rationale is that if the upper bound travel - time between a query object q and a particular data object p i is less than the lower bound travel - times from q to any other data object, then p i is the nearest neighbor of q in a time - dependent network. we repeat the same process for each data object to compute its tight cell. fig4 depicts the network expansion from the data objects during the tight cell construction for p i. for the sake of clarity, we represent the tight cell of each data object with a polygon as shown in fig5. we generate the edges of the polygons by connecting the adjacent border nodes ( i. e., nodes where the shortest path trees meet ) of a generator to each other. lemma 1 proves the property of tc : lemma 1 : let p be a set of data objects p = { p 1, p 2,. . . , p n } in g t and tc ( p i ) be the tight cell of a data object p i. for any query point q tc ( p i ), the nearest neighbor of q is p i, i. e., { p i p, p j p i, tdfp ( q, p i, t ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p j, t ) }. proof. we prove the lemma by contradiction. assume that p i is not the nearest neighbor of the query object q. then there exists a data object p j ( p i p j ) which is closer to q ; i. e., tdfp ( q, p j, t ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p i, t ). let us now consider a point b ( where the shortest path trees of p i and p j meet ) on the boundary of the tight cell tc ( p i ). we denote shortest upper - bound path from p i to b ( i. e., the shortest path among all utt ( p i b ) paths ) as d utt ( p i, b ), and similarly, we denote shortest lower - bound path from p j to b ( i. e., the shortest path among all ltt ( p j b ) paths ) as d ltt ( p j, b ). then, we have tdfp ( q, p i, t ) & lt ; d utt ( p i, b ) = d ltt ( p j, b ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p j, t ). this is a contradiction ; hence, tdfp ( q, p i, t ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p j, t ). as described in section 4. 2, if a query point, q, is inside a specific tc, one can immediately identify the generator of that tc as the nearest neighbor for q. this stage can be expedited by using a spatial index structure generated on the tcs. although tcs are constructed based on the network distance metric, each tc is actually a polygon in euclidean space. therefore, tcs can be indexed using spatial index structures ( e. g., r - tree as in antonin guttman ; r - trees : a dynamic index structure for spatial searching ; proceedings of sigmod, pages 47 - 57, boston, mass., 1984 ). this way a function ( i. e., contain ( q ) ) invoked on the spatial index structure would efficiently return the tc whose generator has the minimum time - dependent network distance to q. we formally define tight network index as follows. definition 5 : let p be the set of data objects p = { p 1, p 2,. . . , p n }, the tight network index is a spatial index structure generated on { tc ( p 1 ), tc ( p 2 ),. . . , tc ( p n ) }. as illustrated in fig5, the set of tight cells often does not cover the entire network. for the cases where q is located in an area which is not covered by any tight cell, we utilize the loose network index ( lni ) to identify the candidate nearest data objects. next, we describe lni. loose network index ( lni ) : the loose cell lc ( p i ) is a sub - network around p i outside which any point is guaranteed not to have p i as its nearest neighbor. in other words, data object p i is guaranteed not to be the nearest neighbor of q if q is outside of the loose cell of p i. similar to the construction process for tc ( p i ), we use the parallel shortest path tree expansion to construct lc ( p i ). however, this time, we use minimum travel - time between the nodes of the network ( i. e., ltt ) to expand from p i ( i. e., the generator of the loose cell ) and maximum travel - time ( i. e., utt ) to expand from every other data object. lemma 2 proves the property of lc : lemma 2 : let p be a set of data objects p = { p 1 p 2,. . . , p n } in g t and lc ( p i ) be the loose cell of a data object p i. if q is outside of lc ( p i ), p i is guaranteed not to be the nearest neighbor of q, i. e., { q lc ( p i, p j p, p j p i, tdfp ( q, p i, t ) & gt ; tdfp ( q, p j, t ) }. proof. we prove by contradiction. assume that p i is the nearest neighbor of a q, even though the q is outside of lc ( p i ) ; i. e., tdfp ( q, p i, t ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p j, t ). suppose there exists a data object p j whose loose cell lc ( p j ) covers q ( such a data object must exist, because as we will next prove by lemma 3, the set of loose cells cover the entire network ). let b be a point on the boundary of lc ( p i ). then, we have, tdfp ( q, p j, t ) & lt ; d utt ( p j, b ) = d ltt ( p i, b ) & lt ; tdfp ( q, p i, t ). this is a contradiction ; hence, p i cannot be the nearest neighbor of q. as illustrated in fig6, loose cells, unlike tcs, collectively cover the entire network and have some overlapping regions among each other. lemma 3 : loose cells may overlap, and they collectively cover the network. proof. as we mentioned, during loose cell construction, ltt is used for expansion from the generator of the loose cell. since the parallel dijkstra algorithm traverses every node until the priority queue is empty as described in the graph voronoi diagram with applications ( journal of networks, 36, 2000 ), every node in the network is visited ; hence, the network is covered. since the process of expansion with ltt is repeated for each data object, in the overall process some nodes are visited more than once ; hence, the overlapping areas. therefore, loose cells cover the entire network and may have overlapping areas. note that if the edge weights are constant, the lcs would not overlap, and tcs cells and lcs would be the same. based on the properties of tight and loose cells, we know that loose cells and tight cells have common edges ( i. e., all the tight cell edges are also the edges of loose cells ). we refer to data objects that share common edges as direct neighbors and remark that loose cells of the direct neighbors always overlap. for example, consider fig6 where the direct neighbors of p 2 are p 1, p 3, and p 6. this property is especially useful for processing k 1 neighbors ( see section 4. 2 ) after finding the first nearest neighbor. we determine the direct neighbors during the generation of the loose cells and store the neighborhood information in a data component. therefore, finding the neighboring cells does not require any complex operation. similar to tni, we can use spatial index structures to access loose cells efficiently. we formally define the loose network index ( lni ) as follows. definition 6 : let p be the set of data objects p = { p 1, p 2,. . . , p n }, the loose network index is a spatial index structure generated on { lc ( p 1 ), lc ( p 2 ),. . . , lc ( p n ) }. note that lni and tni are complementary index structures. specifically, if a q cannot be located with tni ( i. e., q falls outside of any tc ), then we use lni to identify the lcs that contain q ; based on lemma 2, the generators of such lcs are the only nn candidates for q. various data structures and update techniques can be employed. in some implementations, an r - tree like data structure can be used to implement tni and lni, termed tn r - tree and ln r - tree, respectively. fig7 depicts ln r - tree ( tn r - tree is a similar data structure without extra pointers at the leaf nodes, hence not discussed in detail ). as shown, ln r - tree has the basic structure of an r - tree generated on minimum bounding rectangles of loose cells. the difference is that we modify r - tree by linking its leaf nodes to the the pointers of additional components that facilitate td - knn query processing. these components are the direct neighbors ( n ( p i ) ) of p i and the list of nodes ( vl p i ) that are inside lc ( p i ). while n ( p i ) is used to filter the set of candidate nearest neighbors where k & gt ; 1, we use vl p i to prune the search space during tdsp computation ( see section 4. 2 ). these proposed index structures will need to be updated when the set of data objects and / or the travel - time profiles change. fortunately, due to local precomputation nature of td - knn, the affect of the updates with both cases are local, hence requiring minimal change in tight and loose cell index structures. below, we explain each update type. data object updates : we consider two types of object update ; insertion and deletion ( object relocation is performed by a deletion following by insertion at the new location ). with a location update of a data object p i, only the tight and loose cells of p i & # 39 ; s neighbors are updated locally. in particular, when a new p i is inserted, first we find the loose cell ( s ) lc ( p j ) containing p i. clearly, we need to shrink lc ( p j ) and since the loose cells and tight cells share common edges, the region that contains lc ( p j ) and lc ( p j ) & # 39 ; s direct neighbors needs to be adjusted. towards that end, we find the neighbors of lc ( p j ) ; the tight and loose cells of these direct neighbors are the only ones affected by the insertion. finally, we compute the new tcs and lcs for p i, p j and p j & # 39 ; s direct neighbors by updating our index structures. deletion of a p i is similar and hence not discussed. edge travel - time updates : with travel - time updates, we do not need to update our index structures. this is because the tight and loose cells are generated based on the minimum ( ltt ) and maximum ( utt ) travel - times of the edges in the network that are time - independent. the only case we need to update our index structures is when minimum and / or maximum travel - time of an edge changes, which is not that frequent. moreover, similar to the data object updates, the affect of the travel - time profile update is local. when the maximum and / or minimum travel - time of an edge e i changes in the network, we first find the loose cell ( s ) lc ( p j ) that overlaps with e i and thereafter recompute the tight and loose cells of lc ( p j ) and its direct neighbors. section 4. 2 td - k nn query processing ( online ) : the properties of tni and lni are defined above. the description below provides details regarding how these index structures can be used to process k nn queries in g t. below, we first describe an algorithm to find the nearest neighbor ( i. e., k = 1 ), and then we extend it to address the k nn case ( i. e., k 1 ). nearest neighbor query : use tni and lni to identify the nearest neighbor of a query object q. given the location of q, carry out a depth - first search from the tni root to the node that contains q ( line 5 of algorithm 1, shown in fig8 a ). if a tight cell that contains q is located, return the generator of that tight cell as the first nn. experiments show that, in most cases ( 7 out of 10 ), q can be found with the tni search ( see section 5. 2 ). if q cannot be located in tni ( i. e., when q falls outside all tight cells ), proceed to search lni ( line 7 ). at this step, one or more loose cells that contain q are found. based on lemma 2, the generators of these loose cells are the only possible candidates to be the nn for q. therefore, compute tdfp to find the distance between q and each candidate in order to determine the first nn ( line 8 - 12 ). the candidates can be stored in a minimum heap based on their travel - time to q ( line 10 ), and the nearest neighbor cab be retrieved from the heap ( line 12 ). k nn query the following algorithm for finding the remaining k 1 nns is based on the direct neighbor property discussed in section 4. 1. the second nn must be among the direct neighbors of the first nn. thus, once the second nn is identifeid, we continue by including the neighbors of the second nn to find the third nn and so on. this search algorithm is based on the following lemma which is derived from the properties of tni and lni. lemma 4 : the i - th nearest neighbor of q is always among the neighbors of the i 1 nearest neighbors of q. proof. we prove this lemma by induction. we prove the base case ( i. e., the second nn is a direct neighbor of the first nn of q ) by contradiction. consider fig9 where p 2 is the first nn of q. assume that p 5 ( which is not a direct neighbor of p 2 ) is the second nn of q. since p 2 and p 5 are not direct neighbors, a point w on the time - dependent shortest path between q and p 5 can be found that is outside both lc ( p 2 ) and lc ( p 5 ), however, p 5 cannot be a candidate nn for w, because w is not in lc ( p 5 ). thus, there exists another object such as p 1 which is closer to w as compared to p 5. therefore, tdfp ( w, p 5, t ) & gt ; tdfp ( w, p 1, t ). however, as shown in fig9, we have tdfp ( q, p 5, t ) = tdfp ( q, w, t ) + tdfp ( w, p 5, t ) & gt ; tdfp ( q, w, t ) + tdfp ( w, p 1, t ) = tdfp ( q, p 1, t ). thus, p 5 is farther from q than both p 2 and p 1, which contradicts the assumption that p 5 is the second nn of q. the proof of inductive step is straight forward and similar to the above proof by contradiction ; thus, the details are inherent in the disclosure already provided, and further details are not explicity presented here. the complete td - k nn query answering process is given in algorithm 2 ( shown in fig8 b ). algorithm 2 calls algorithm 1 to find the first nn and add it to n, which maintains the current set of nearest neighbors ( lines 4 - 5 ). to find the remaining k 1 nns, expand the search area by including the neighboring loose cells of the first nn. compute the tdsp for each candidate and add each candidate to a minimum heap ( lines 9 ) based on its time - dependent travel - time to q. thereafter, select the one with minimum distance as the second nn ( line 11 ). once the second nn is identified, continue by investigating the neighbor loose cells of the second nn to find the third nn and so on. experiments show that the average number of neighbors for a data object is a relatively small number less than 9 ( see section 5. 2 ). time - dependent fastest path computation : as explained, once the nearest neighbor of q is found and the candidate set is determined, the time - dependent fastest path from q to all candidates is computed in order to find the next nn. before further details of an example of the tdfp computation are provided, a very useful property of loose cells should be noted. that is, given p i is the nearest neighbor of q, the time - dependent shortest path from q to p i is guaranteed to be in lc ( p i ) ( see lemma 5 ). this property indicates that one only need consider the edges contained in the loose cell of p i when computing tdfp from q to p i. this property allows one to localize the time - dependent shortest path search by extensively pruning the search space. since the localized area of a loose cell is substantially smaller as compared to the complete graph, the computation cost of tdfp is significantly reduced. note that the subnetwork bounded by a loose cell is on average 1 / n of the original network where n is the total number of sites. lemma 5 : if p i is the nearest neighbor of q, then the time - dependent shortest path from q to p i is guaranteed to be inside the loose cell of p i proof. we prove by contradiction. assume that p i is the nn of q but a portion of tdfp from q to p i passes outside of lc ( p i ). suppose a point l on that outside portion of the path. since l is outside lc ( p i ), then p j p, p j p i that satisfies d ltt ( p i, l ) & gt ; d utt ( p j, l ) and hence tdfp ( p i, l, t ) & gt ; tdfp ( p j, l, t ). then, tdfp ( p i, q, t ) = tdfp ( p i, l, t ) + tdfp ( l, q, t ) & gt ; tdfp ( p j, l, t ) + tdfp ( l, q, t ) = tdfp ( p j, q, t ), which contradicts the fact that p i is the nn of q. we note that for td - knn with k & gt ; 1, the tdfp from q to the kth nearest neighbor will lie in the combined area of neighboring cells. fig1 shows an example of a query with k & gt ; 1, where p 2 is assumed to be the nearest neighbor ( and the candidate neighbors of p 2 are, p 1, p 6 and p 3 ). to compute the tdfp from q to data object p 1, one need only consider the edges contained in lc ( p 1 ) lc ( p 2 ). below, the details of how to compute the tdfp from q to each candidate, according to some implementations, are provided. as initially showed by dreyfus in an appraisal of some shortest path algorithms ( journal of operation research 17, ny, usa, 1969 ), the tdfp problem ( in fifo networks ) can be solved by modifying any label - setting or label - correcting static shortest path algorithm. the asymptotic running times of these modified algorithms are same as those of their static counterparts. with our approach, we implement a time - dependent a * search ( a label - setting algorithm ) to compute tdfp between q and the candidate set. the main idea with a * algorithm is to employ a heuristic function h ( v ) ( i. e., lower - bound estimator between the intermediate node v i and the target t ) that directs the search towards the target and significantly reduces the number of nodes that have to be traversed. with static road networks where the length of an edge is considered as the cost, the euclidean distance between v i and t is the lower - bound estimator. however, with time - dependent road networks, we propose an estimator that never overestimates the travel - time between v i and t for all possible departure - times ( from v i ). one simple lower - bound is d euc ( v i, t ) / max ( speed ), i. e., the euclidean distance between v i and t divided by the maximum speed among the edges in the entire network. although this estimator is guaranteed to be a lower - bound between v i and t, it is a very loose bound, hence yields insignificant pruning. fortunately, our approach can use lemma 5 to obtain a much tighter lower - bound. since the shortest path from q to p i is guaranteed to be inside lc ( p i ), we can use the maximum speed in lc ( p i ) to compute the lower - bound. we outline our time - dependent a * algorithm in algorithm 3 ( shown in fig1 ) where essential modifications ( as compared to dreyfus, p. ; an appraisal of some shortest path algorithms ; journal of operation research 17, ny, usa, 1969 ) are in lines 3, 10 and 14. as mentioned, to compute tdfp from q to candidate p i, one need only consider the nodes in the loose cell that contains q and lc ( p i ) ( line 3 ). to compute the labels for each node, arrival time and the estimator are used ( i. e., cos t ( v i ) + h lc ( v i ) where h lc ( v i ) is the lower - bound estimator calculated based on the maximum speed in the loose cell ) to each node that form the basis of the greedy algorithm ( line 10 ). in lines 10 and 14, tt ( v i, v j, t v i ) finds the time - dependent travel - time from v i to v j ( see section 3 ). section 5 experimental evaluation ; section 5. 1 experimental setup : we conducted several experiments with different spatial networks and various parameters ( see fig1 ) to evaluate the performance of td - k nn. we ran our experiments on a workstation with 2. 7 ghz pentium duo processor and 12 gb ram memory. we continuously monitored each query for 100 timestamps. for each set of experiments, we only varied one parameter and fixed the remaining to the default values in fig1. with our experiments, we measured the tight cell hit ratio and the impact of k, data and query object cardinality as well as the distribution. as our dataset, we used los angeles ( la ) and san joaquin ( sj ) road networks with 304, 162 and 24, 123 segments, respectively. we evaluated our techniques using a database of actual time - dependent travel - times gathered from real - world traffic sensor data. we have collected and archived speed, occupancy, and volume sensor data from a collection of approximately 7000 sensors located on the road network of la. the sampling rate of the data is 1 reading / sensor / min. at one time, our database consisted of about 900 million sensor readings representing traffic patterns on the road network segments of la. in order to create the time - dependent edge weights of sj, we developed a system ( see ugur demiryurek and bei pan and farnoush banaei kashani and cyrus shahabi ; towards modeling the traffic data on road networks ; proceedings of sigspatial - iwcts, 2009 ; which is hereby incorporated by reference ) that synthetically generates time - dependent edge weights for sj. section 5. 2 results : impact of tight cell hit ratio and direct neighbors : as explained, if a q is located in a certain tight cell tc ( p i ), the algorithm immediately reports p i as the first nn. therefore, it is essential to asses the coverage area of the tight cells over the entire network. fig1 a illustrates the coverage ratio of the tight cells with varying data object cardinality ( ranging from 1k to 20k ) on two data sets. as shown, the average tight cell coverage is about 68 % of the entire network for both la and sj. this implies that the first nn of a query can be answered immediately with a ratio of 7 / 10 with no further computation. another important parameter affecting the td - k nn algorithm is the average number of direct neighbors for each data object. fig1 a depicts a coverage ratio, and fig1 b depicts the average number of neighbor cells with varying data object cardinality. as shown, the average number of neighbors is less than 9 for both la and sj. as mentioned, we developed an incremental network expansion algorithm ( based on dreyfus, p. ; an appraisal of some shortest path algorithms ; journal of operation research 17, ny, usa, 1969 ) to evaluate k nn queries in time - dependent networks. below we compare our results with this naive approach. for the rest of the experiments, since the experimental results with both la and sj networks differ insignificantly, we only present the results from la dataset. impact of k : in this experiment, we compared the performance of both algorithms by varying the value of k. fig1 a plots the average response time versus k ranging from 1 to 50 while using default settings in fig1 for other parameters. the results show that td - k nn outperforms naive approach for all values of k and scales better with the large values of k. as illustrated, when k = 1, td - k nn generates the result set almost instantly. this is because a simple contain ( ) function is enough to find the first nn. as the value of k increases, the response time of td - k nn increases at linear rate. because, td - k nn, rather than expanding the search blindly, benefits from localized computation. in addition, we compared the average number of network node access with both algorithms. as shown in fig1 b, the number of nodes accessed by td - k nn is less than the naive approach for all values of k impact of object and query cardinality : next, we compared the algorithms with respect to cardinality of the data objects ( p ). fig1 a shows the impact of p on response time. the response time linearly increases with the number of data objects in both methods, but td - k nn outperforms the naive approach for all cases. from p = 1k to 5k, the performance gap is more significant. this is because, for lower densities where data objects are possibly distributed sparsely, the naive approach requires larger portion of the network to be retrieved. fig1 b shows the impact of the query cardinality ( q ) ranging from 1k to 5k on response time. as shown, td - k nn scales better with larger q and the performance gap between the approaches increases as q grows. impact of object / query distribution : finally, we studied the impact of object, query distribution. fig1 c shows the response time of both algorithms where the objects and queries follow either uniform or gaussian distributions. td - k nn outperforms the naive approach significantly in all cases. td - k nn yields better performance for queries with gaussian distribution. this is because as queries with gaussian distribution are clustered in the network, their nearest neighbors would overlap hence allowing td - k nn to reuse the path computations. section 6 conclusion and future work : in this paper, we proposed a time - dependent k nearest neighbor search algorithm ( td - k nn ) for spatial networks. with td - k nn, unlike the existing studies, we make edge weights of the network time varying rather than fixed. in the real - world, time - varying edge utilization is inherit in almost all networks ( e. g., transportation, internet, social networks ). hence, we believe that our approach yields a much more realistic scenario and is applicable to k nn applications in other domains. thus, the systems and techniques described in this paper can be expanded to include new data models for effective representation of time - dependent spatial networks. this can assist in supporting development of efficient and accurate time - dependent algorithms, while minimizing the storage and cost of the computation. in addition, a variety of other spatial queries ( including continuous knn, range and skyline queries ) can be explored in time - dependent networks. the processes described above, and all of the functional operations described in this specification, can be implemented in electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them, such as the structural means disclosed in this specification and structural equivalents thereof, including potentially a program ( stored in a machine - readable medium ) operable to cause one or more programmable machines including processor ( s ) ( e.. g., a computer ) to perform the operations described. it will be appreciated that the order of operations presented is shown only for the purpose of clarity in this description. no particular order may be required for these operations to achieve desirable results, and various operations can occur simultaneously or at least concurrently. in certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be preferable. the various implementations described above have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. thus, the principles, elements and features described may be employed in varied and numerous implementations, and various modifications may be made to the described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. accordingly, other embodiments may be within the scope of the following claims.","the class of k nearest neighbor queries in spatial networks has been studied in the literature . existing approaches for k nn search in spatial networks assume that the weight of each edge in the spatial network is constant . however , real - world edge - weights are time - dependent and vary significantly in short durations , hence invalidating the existing solutions . the problem of k nn search in time - dependent spatial networks , where the weight of each edge is a function of time , is addressed herein . two indexing schemes are proposed to minimize the number of candidate nearest neighbor objects and reduce the invocation of the expensive fastest -

specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. the order in which the steps are presented below is not limited to any particular order and does not necessarily imply that they have to be performed in the order presented. it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the order of these steps can be rearranged and performed in any suitable manner. it will further be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that some steps may be omitted or added and still fall within the spirit of the invention. referring to fig1, the present invention includes a cutting device 30. the cutting device 30 preferably includes a drill end 32. the drill end 32 is preferably configured to be rotated to make a hole on a part of a drum gear, which is a structure that connects the drum to the printer and allows the drum to rotate when the printer is in operation ( not shown ). cutting device 30 preferably also includes a drill shaft 34 extending from a non - pointed side of the drill end 32. the drill shaft 34 preferably defines a horizontal plane a and a vertical plane b. the drill shaft 34 preferably defines a recess 36 extending from side to side or laterally. the recess 36 preferably lies on the horizontal plane a. the height of the recess 36 preferably spans the entire vertical plane b of the drill shaft 34. a pair of moveable cutting edges 38 a and 38 b is preferably positioned to move in and out of the recess 36. the pair of movable cutting edges 38 a and 38 b is preferably positioned to move in the direction that is opposite to each other & # 39 ; s direction of movement. each cutting edge 38 preferably includes a structure with substantially pointed edge, as shown in fig1. the level of the sharpness or the dullness of the pointed edge may be varied depending on the efficiency of the cutting and the smoothness of the cut surface the user desires. the number and position of the cutting edges around the shaft may also be varied. cutting device 30 preferably further includes a stop collar 40 attached to a portion of the drill shaft 34 where the recess 36 runs. the stop collar 40 preferably surrounds the outer surface of the drill shaft 34 and covers a portion of the recess 36. the stop collar 40 preferably rotates with the drill shaft 34. the stop collar 40 is shown to be circular in shape in fig1. however, the stop collar 40 may be designed with various shapes. the position of the stop collar 40 on the drill shaft 34 is preferably adjacent to the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b and in between an actuating mechanism 44 and the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b. the stop collar 40 preferably includes a stop surface 42, which is preferably substantially flat and configured to abut a part of the cartridge ( not shown ). the distance between the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b and the stop collar 40 is preferably predetermined depending on where on the drum or the drum gear the cutting device is designed to make the cut. once the location of the cut is determined, the distance between the location of the cut and the part of the cartridge to which the stop surface 42 will abut can be calculated. the calculated distance may be used in positioning the stop collar 40 on the drill shaft 34. that is, the calculated distance may be used as the distance between the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b and the position of the stop surface 42 on the drill shaft 34. it can be realized that the cutting device 30 of the present invention provides a way to cut in a manner where the location of the cut may be adjusted and may be determined with precision. the drill shaft 34 and the recess 36 therein preferably extend sideways past the location of the stop collar 40. substantially adjacent to the stop collar 40 and substantially opposite the drill end 32 on the drill shaft 34 is preferably an actuating mechanism 44 for the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b, which is discussed further below. the drill shaft 34 preferably includes an end 45 opposite the drill end 32, which preferably includes a drill attachment tip 46 attached thereto. the drill attachment tip 46 preferably includes a non - circular periphery such that an electric drill ( not shown ) may easily grasp the tip 46 and electrically rotate the drill shaft 34. with reference now to fig2, the actuating mechanism 44 for the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b is shown and preferably includes cutter arms 48 a and 48 b, arm actuation device 56, actuation device handle 58, and actuation device stop collar 60. each cutting edge 38 a and 38 b is preferably integral to or a part of a corresponding cutter arm 48 a and 48 b. each cutter arm 48 preferably includes a first component 50 a or 50 b, which is preferably positioned within the confines of the drill shaft 34. first components 50 a and 50 b preferably extend to their respective second components 52 a or 52 b, which are preferably positioned at an angle relative to the first components 50 a and 50 b. in the preferred embodiment, the second component 52 is preferably at an angle between 90 - 180 degrees from the first component 50. substantial portions of the second components 52 preferably project out of the confines of the drill shaft 34 through the recess 36. each cutter arm 48 is preferably attached to the drill shaft 34 via a mechanical pin 54 a or 54 b positioned within the confines of the recess 36 and attached to the interior wall of the drill shaft 34. each cutter arm 48 may preferably pivot around its respective mechanical pin 54. with continued reference to fig2, each second component 52 of the cutter arm 48 is preferably moveably attached to the arm actuating device 56 from an end that is distal and opposite from the cutting edges 38. each of said second component end preferably defines a lateral recess 62 a and 62 b extending from side to side. the arm actuating device 56 preferably attaches to each second component via a mechanical pin 64 a or 64 b that passes through the recess 62 a or 62 b and that is attached to the arm actuating device 56. the mechanical pin 64 is preferably configured to slide within the recess 62 when the actuating device 56 is operated to activate the cutting edges 38. the actuating device 56 is preferably a structure that defines a cylindrical recess configured to accommodate the drill shaft 34. the drill shaft 34 is preferably inserted through this cylindrical recess to allow the actuating device 56 to slide sideways on the drill shaft 34. the actuating device may be made with various shapes. the actuating device 56 is preferably attached to one end of a biasing device 66. the other end of the biasing device 66 is preferably attached to the stop collar 40. it can be realized from fig2 that the actuating device 56 is preferably biased to move toward the stop collar 40 in the deactivated position. in the deactivated position, the biasing device 66 also positions the actuating device 56 and the mechanical pin 64 toward the stop collar 40. first component 50 a is preferably biased to pivot counterclockwise. first component 50 b is preferably biased to pivot clockwise. in other words, in the deactivated position, cutter arms 48 a and 48 b are biased to pivot toward each other. as a result, the cutting edges 38 a and 38 are preferably positioned to be contained inside the confines of the drill shaft 34 when the actuating device 56 is deactivated. with continued reference to fig2, an actuation device stop collar 60 that wraps around and is attached to the drill shaft 34 may be provided to limit the sliding distance of the actuating device 56. the actuating device 56, the stop collar 60, and the stop collar 40 preferably wrap around the drill shaft 34 rotates with the drill shaft 34. the actuation device stop collar 60 is preferably positioned on the drill shaft 34 at a predetermined distance relative to the actuating device 56. the predetermined distance is preferably based on the desired maximum height of the cutting edge 38 when the cutting device 30 will be operated. the height of the cutting edge 38 that will project out of the recess 36 is directly proportional to the distance between the actuation device stop collar 60 and the actuating device 56. it can be realized that the height of the cutting edge 38 from the drill shaft 34 determines the depth of the cut created by the cutting edge 38. referring now to fig3, the actuating mechanism 44 may be activated as follows. a user may hold a handle 58 attached to the actuating device 56 and pull said handle 58 towards the stop collar 60 as indicated by the arrow. the handle 58 preferably includes an elongate body and a circular body attached thereto, which is preferably configured to surround the actuating device 56. the periphery of the actuating device 56 is preferably attached to the circular body, such that when the handle 58 is pulled, the actuating device 56 is carried by the circular body while, at the same time, when the shaft 34 is rotated, the actuating device 56 rotates with the shaft 34 around the circular body of the handle 58. thus, when the handle 58 is pulled towards the stop collar 60, the actuating device 56 moves along with the handle 58, the biasing device 66 is stretched, and the mechanical pin 64 contained in the recess 62 defined by the cutter arm 48 is moved toward the actuating device 56. the cutter arm 48 preferably pivots around mechanical pin 54 and causes first component 50 a to pivot clockwise and first component 50 b to pivot counterclockwise. the result is that when the actuating mechanism is activated, cutting edges 38 a and 38 b are caused to pass through the recess 36 and project out of the drill shaft 34, as indicated by the arrow and as shown in fig4. it can be realized that the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b are now in a position to contact the objects introduced to them. an electric drill may be used to rotate the drill shaft 34 and the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b to cut an object. for instance, the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b may be used to cut a portion of a drum gear that holds the drum to a cartridge thereby allowing the removal of the drum from the cartridge ( fig8 and 9 ). in addition to the various embodiments of the cutting tool 30, the present invention also includes methods of remanufacturing a toner cartridge, which will now be discussed. in the discussion below, laser printer cartridges from hewlett packard company having model numbers hp 1600, hp 2600, and hp 2605 are used as examples for ease of description. the methods are by no means limited to the remanufacturing of laser printer cartridges from hewlett packard company. the methods may be executed in remanufacturing of cartridges of various types of printers from various companies. as shown in fig5 and 6, a used toner cartridge typically includes a toner hopper 20, which is usually refilled with toner during remanufacturing and a waste hopper 21, which may be cleaned during remanufacturing. the drum of the used toner cartridge may also need to be replaced. to access the drum, the toner hopper 20 and the waste hopper 21 are preferably separated by detaching the screws 22 a and 22 b, springs 23 a and 23 b, and pins 24 a and 24 b. in fig7 - 11, a typical toner cartridge drum 26 includes a cylindrical body 25 with hollow interior ( not shown ). the drum typically includes a drum gear 27 configured to be connected to the printer ( not shown ) and allow the drum the rotate when the printer is in operation. the drum gear may have a cylindrical body 28 and are attached to both ends of the drum body 25. some drum gears include a gear wall 29 ( fig7 ) positioned perpendicular to the cylindrical body of the drum gear. it can be realized that when the drum gear is attached to the drum and the drum is attached to the cartridge, the gear wall 29 may serve to block access to the hollow interior of the cylindrical drum body. the gear wall 29 may also block access to a gear portion in between the gear wall and the drum. referring now to fig8, once the toner hopper and the waste hopper are separated, the cutting tool 30 may be used to remove the drum 26 from the cartridge 31. the cutting tool 30 is preferably attached to an electric drill 33. the electric drill 33 preferably allows the drill end 32 of the cutting tool to puncture and enter through the gear wall 29. once drill end 32 enters through the gear wall 29, the drill shaft 34 also enters through the gear wall and in the hollow interiors of the cylindrical bodies of the gear and the drum. it can be realized that if the drum gear does not have a gear wall, an embodiment of the cutting tool need not include a drill end 32 attached to the drill shaft 34. referring now to fig9, once the drill shaft 34 is inserted through the hollow interior of the drum gear, the stop collar 40 preferably abuts the cartridge portion 31 to prevent further forward motion of the drill end and shaft. the user may activate the actuating mechanism 44 by pulling the handle 30 towards the electric drill 33 while keeping the stop collar 40 abutted to the cartridge portion 31. the user may continue pulling if the handle in the direction indicated preferably until the actuating device 56 abuts the stop collar 60. as the user pulls the handle in the direction indicated, the cutter arm 48 a preferably pivots clockwise and cutter arm 48 b preferably pivots counterclockwise ( not shown in fig9 ). the result is that the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b are caused to pass through the recess 36 and project out of the drill shaft 34 ( not shown in fig9 ). the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b consequently contact the interior wall of the cylindrical body of the drum gear 27. the electric drill preferably rotates the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b, which eventually cuts the drum gear 27 at the area indicated by arrow c. the area indicated by arrow c is preferably a gear portion in between the drum body 26 and the cartridge 31. the cut made by the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b are preferably around the circumference or the periphery of a gear portion ( as shown in fig1 ). it can be appreciated that, with the present invention, the precision of the location of the area where the cutting edges 38 and 38 b will make a cut can be attained by adjusting the distance between of the stop collar 40 relative to the cutting edges 38 a and 38 b. referring now to fig1 and 11, the drum 26 may now be detached from the cartridge 31. it can be appreciated from fig1 that the cutting device 30 of the present invention is able to cut the gear 27 of the drum from the hollow interior of the cylindrical body 28 of the gear and cleanly cut the periphery of the cylindrical body 28 of the drum gear 27 ( fig1 and 11 ). it can now be realized that the present invention facilitates the removal of the drum with little or no requirement of having to break any portion of the cartridge 31. this advantage is highly beneficial in the remanufacturing of cartridges, as the appearance of the cartridge is preserved. additionally, since the removal of the drum by the present invention reduces or avoids having to break any portion of cartridges, the present invention avoids extraneous steps of having to put back broken cartridges. it can further be realized that the present invention provides a new cutting tool and technique for cutting hollow objects from its hollow interior. it can also be realized that the present invention provides a new technique for efficiently removing and replacing a toner cartridge drum, which may be practiced when remanufacturing a previously used toner cartridge. although the description above contains many specifications, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. for example, various mechanical fasteners known in the art may be used in lieu of the mechanical pins described herein. the cutting device may be used for cutting hollow objects from the hollow interior side of the objects other than toner cartridge drums. the shapes of the stop collars and the actuating device may be varied. the shapes and number of cutting edges and cutter arms may be varied. the invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the construction and to the arrangement of the components set forth in the above description or as illustrated in the drawings.","a method of removing a drum from a

"referring now to fig3 an image sensor 10 is for scanning the original 7 shown in fig2 on which a mark 8 of a specific color is drawn. the image sensor 10 outputs a mark detection signal & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; when the mark 8 is detected. a serial / parallel converter 11, which comprises a 6 - bit shift register, converts a 1 - bit picture signal sequentially fed from the image sensor 10 into a 6 - bit parallel signal through the sequential shift at the sampling period of the sensor 10, and applies this parallel signal to an or circuit 12. the or circuit 12 performs logical sum for the picture signal at each bit of the serial / parallel converter 11, and feeds the output signal to a binary counter 14 through a low - pass filter 13. by performing the above logical sum, even when the mark 8 is not clear, the detection of the picture signal can be assured. in addition, by directing the signal through the low - pass filter 13, noise due to stain on the original or other cause can be removed. the binary counter 14 outputs & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ;, and is cleared to & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; when a synchronizing signal sy which is output each time a scan is completed is fed. thereafter, each time the picture signal ps which is fed from the low - pass filter rises to & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ;, the binary counter 14 outputs the signal & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; and the signal & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; alternately. accordingly, as shown in fig4 ( b ), when the picture signal ps rises to & # 34 ;

1 & # 34 ; the first time and the time when the picture signal ps rises to & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; the next time as shown in fig4 ( c ). on the other hand, when the picture signal ps rises only once in a scan as shown in fig6 ( b ), the binary counter 14 outputs & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; during the period between the time when the picture signal ps rises to & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; as shown in fig6 ( c ) and the time when the synchronizing signal sy is fed. the output of the binary counter 14 is fed to a random access memory 15 and the input d of a latch circuit 16. the memory 15 temporarily stores the output signal of the binary counter 14 as a data indicating a certain period in a single scan line and outputs the stored signal in the next scan line in the same form, and applies the signal thus output to an and circuit 17. the latch circuit 16 latches the output signal of the binary counter 14 fed to its input d at the timing when the synchronizing signal sy is fed, applies the latched signal to an inverter 18 for the signal inversion, and feeds the signal thus inverted to the and circuit 17. the latch circuit 16 performs latching when the synchronizing signal sy rises, and the counter 14 is cleared when the synchronizing signal falls, i. e., the latch circuit latches the counter output immediately before the binary counter 14 is cleared by the synchronizing signal sy. therefore, when the number of the mark detection signals & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; fed to the binary counter 14 in a single scan is an even number ( including 0 ), the output of the latch circuit 16 becomes & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; ( refer to fig4 ( d ) ), while when the number is an odd number, the output of the latch circuit 16 becomes & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; ( refer to fig6 ( d ) ). the and circuit 17 becomes operational when the signal latched by the latched circuit 16 is & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ;, i. e., when the signal & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; is output from the inverter 18. when two mark detection signals & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; appear during the scan line ti as shown in fig4 ( b ), i. e., when the scan line intersects the mark 8 twice as shown in fig2 the latch circuit 16 latches the output & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; of the counter 14, and the output of the inverter 18 becomes & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; in the next scan line ti + 1 as shown in fig5 ( c ). as a result, the memory content of the memory 15 shown in fig5 ( b ) is output from the and circuit 17 as shown in fig5 ( d ). this output of the and circuit 17 represents the position and the length of the section between two points at which the scan line intersects the mark 8. on the other hand, when only one mark detection signal & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; appears during the scan line ti as shown in fig6 ( b ), i. e., when the scan line contacts the top or bottom point of the mark 8, the latch circuit 16 latches the output & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; of the counter 14, and the output of the inverter 18 becomes & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; in the next scan line ti + 1 as shown in fig7 ( c ). accordingly, in this case, the memory content of the memory 15 shown in fig7 ( b ) is not output from the and circuit 17 as shown in fig8 ( d ). in this manner, when the mark 8 as shown in fig2 is entered on the original 7, the signal representing the position and the length of the section between the scan points is picked up at the output end of the and circuit 17 only when the scan line of the image sensor 10 intersects the mark 8 twice. accordingly, the area a & # 39 ; enclosed with the mark 8 can be detected based on the output signal of the and circuit 17 in each scan line. when the area a & # 39 ; is detected, processing such as aforementioned erasure, extraction, color copying, enlargement, and reduction can be performed only for the area a & # 39 ;.","the area detection method detects an area on an original enclosed with a mark of specific color by the steps of scanning the original by a photosensor , judging whether the number of the mark segment detected by the photosensor in a single scan line is an even or odd number for each scan and detecting the area based on the output of the photosensor in the scan period for which the judgement is made that the number of the detected mark segment is an even number ."
"beginning now with fig1, a perspective view of a motor drive 100 is depicted. in one embodiment, the motor drive 100 may be a powerflex drive manufactured by rockwell automation of milwaukee, wis. the motor drive 100 may include a housing 102 having cooling vents 104 on one or more sides of the drive 100. to facilitate interacting with the motor drive 100, the motor drive 100 may include a human - machine interface ( hmi ) 106. the hmi 106 may include a display 108, such as an lcd or other display and a keypad 110 allowing input by a user. additionally, the hmi 106 may be removable and dockable in a receptacle 114 in the housing 102. as described further below, the motor drive is adapted to receive three - phase power from a power source, such as the electrical grid and to convert the fixed frequency input power to controlled frequency output power. the motor drive 100 may manage both application of electrical power to the loads, typically including various machines or motors. the drive may also collect data from the loads, or from various sensors associated with the load or the machine system of which the load is part. such data may be used in monitoring and control functions, and may include parameters such as current, voltage, speed, rotational velocity, temperatures, pressures, and so forth. the motor drive 100 may be associated with a variety of components or devices ( not shown ) used in the operation and control of the loads. exemplary devices contained within the motor drive 100 are motor starters, overload relays, circuit breakers, and solid - state motor control devices, such as variable frequency drives, programmable logic controllers, and so forth. as discussed further below, the motor drive 100 may include expandable functionality through the addition of option boards installed in a backplane inside the motor drive 100. additionally, the motor drive 100 may be used in conjunction with other motor drives, such that a plurality of motor drives may be used to control one or more processes. as also discussed below, functions within the drive are synchronized, and the drive ( and its internal functions ) may be synchronized with other drives in an overall machine system. fig2 is a block diagram 200 illustrating various internal components of the drive 100 and other devices in the system 200. for example, the drive 100 may include control circuitry 202, driver circuitry 204, and power electronic switching circuitry 206. the power electronic switching circuitry 206 may receive three - phase power 212, and output three phase power 214 to a motor 216. to facilitate control of the motor drive 100, a remote control monitor 208 may be connected to the motor drive 100. additionally, other drives 210 may also be connected to the motor drive 100 and the remote control monitor 208, such as via a network. remote control and monitoring functions, and coordinated operation of the drive may be performed via such network connections. moreover, such networks and network connections may be based on any known or subsequently developed standard, including standard industrial protocols, ethernet protocols, internet protocols, wireless protocols, and so forth. the control circuitry 202 and driver circuitry 204 may include a control circuit board and various optional function circuits, referred to herein as option boards, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, as discussed further below. the driver circuitry 204 signals the switches of the power electronic switching circuitry 206 to rapidly close and open, resulting in a three phase waveform output across the output terminals 218, 220, and 222. the driver circuitry 204 is controlled by the control circuitry 202, which may operate autonomously, or which may respond to command inputs from the remote control monitor 208 through a network. similarly, operation of the driver circuitry may be coordinated, via the control circuitry, with that of other drives. many different control schemes and functions may be implemented by the control circuitry, and programs for such operation may be stored on the control board, such as for closed loop speed control, closed loop torque control, among many others. fig3 is a schematic diagram of power electronic switching circuitry 206. as mentioned above, the power electronic switching circuitry will typically receive as an input three phase power 214, such as from the power grid. the three phase power source is electrically coupled to a set of input terminals 226, 228, and 230 that provide three phase ac power of constant frequency to rectifier circuitry 232. the rectifier circuitry 232 includes components, such as diodes 234 that perform full wave rectification of the three phase voltage waveform. after rectification, all phases of the incoming power are combined to provide dc power to the low side 236 to the high side 238 of a dc bus. inductors 240 may be coupled to both the high and low sides of the dc bus and act as chokes for smoothing the rectified dc voltage waveform. one or more filter capacitors 242 may link the high side 238 and low side 236 of the dc bus and are also configured to smooth the rectified dc voltage waveform. together, the inductors and capacitors serve to remove most of the ripple from the waveform, so that the dc bus carries a waveform closely approximating a true dc voltage. it should be noted that the three - phase implementation described herein is not intended to be limiting, and the invention may be employed on single - phase circuitry, as well as on circuitry designed for applications other than motor drives. an inverter 244 is coupled to the dc bus and generates a three phase output waveform at a desired frequency for driving a motor 216 connected to the output terminals 218, 220, and 222. in the illustrated embodiment, within the inverter 244, for each phase, two insulated gate bipolar transistors ( igbt & # 39 ; s ) 246 are coupled in series, collector to emitter, between the high side 238 and low side 236 of the dc bus. three of these transistor pairs are then coupled in parallel to the dc bus, for a total of six transistors 246. each of the output terminals 218, 220, and 222 is coupled to one of the outputs between one of the pairs of transistors 246. the driver circuitry 204 signals the transistors 246 to rapidly close and open, resulting in a three phase waveform output across output terminals 218, 220, and 222. the driver circuitry 204 is controlled by the control circuitry 202. in some embodiments, multiple motor drives and motors may be used to control a process. for example, as illustrated in fig4, a process 302 may be controlled by multiple motors 304 such as a first motor m 1, a second motor m 2, a third motor m 3, and a fourth motor m 4. each motor 304 may be controlled by a respective motor drive 306. for example, the motor m 1 may be controlled by motor drive d 1, the motor m 2 may be controlled by motor drive d 2, the motor m 3 may be controlled by motor drive d 3, and the motor m 4 may be controlled by the motor drive d 4. the motor drives 306 may be connected together via a network 308, such as a network employing a known standard communications protocol, such as industrial devicenet, controlnet, or ethernet. a remote control and monitoring station 310 may be connected to the motor drives by the network 308 to provide for control and monitoring of the drives 306, the motors 304 and the process 302. as discussed above, in some embodiments a motor drive may add functionality, connections, or both through the addition of option boards installed in the motor drive. the option boards may be in communication with other motor drives, motors, sensors, or other devices. as discussed above with respect to fig4, for example, multiple drives and motors may be used to control a process. in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a motor drive may provide one or more serial interfaces for the addition of option boards. additionally, to facilitate control of highly synchronized drives and motors, the dedicated serial interface may provide synchronization between each of the option boards and the control board or circuitry of the respective motor drive through the use of synchronized interrupts. additionally, the communication and synchronization between the option boards and the control board may be selected and configured by user, such that different communication speeds may be enabled while maintaining the synchronization. further, some embodiments may include profiles to select and configure the communication and synchronization of the option boards. to facilitate addition of the option cards, a motor drive may include a pod 400 having a chassis 402 as shown in fig5. the pod 400 may be mounted inside a motor drive, and acts as a modular card rack for the option boards discussed below. the pod 400 may include a control board 404, which may manage and process signals received from the option boards, as discussed further below. the control board 404 may include one or more processors 406, ( which may include microprocessors, cpu & # 39 ; s, field programmable gate arrays, etc. ) to provide applications, management and processing. the processor 406 may include or be associated with a memory having applications for operating the control board 404, the option boards in the pod 400, or any other device in the motor drive. for example, the processor 406 may include applications such as an interface, torque control, vector control, drive logic, ethernet logic, etc. the control board 404 may also include a field programmable gate array for communication and simple processing tasks. for example, in an embodiment the field programmable gate array may perform transfer, size, and crc frame adders and receive frame stripping, crc verification, error handling and communication status without processor intervention. additionally, the control board 404 may include additional interfaces for connection to other motor drives or devices in accordance with certain data exchange standards, such as ieee 1588, ethernet, etc. the pod chassis 402 may include a one or more backplanes 408, which generally support and provide the physical interconnect between the control board 404 and various option boards. the backplanes 408 may include a printed circuit board having any number of slots, plugs, connectors, or other interface structures. the backplane 408 provides for distribution of power and data signals, and enables the option cards to be interfaced with a network. for example, as shown in fig5, the backplane 408 includes a plurality of slots 410, configured to receive various option boards as described further below. in one embodiment, the pod 400 may include two backplanes 408 having six slots 410 each. the pod chassis 402 may also include additional features to increase reliability and performance. the chassis 402 may include one or more fans 412 and one or vents 414 on any portion of the chassis 402 to allow for airflow and heat dissipation. fig6 is a cutaway view of the pod 400 illustrating the pod 400 and backplanes 408 in further detail. the backplanes 408 may include a bus board 416 providing the interface slots 410 and the necessary bus routing to the control board 404. the backplane 408 may also include one or more communication ports, such as a multi - pin communication port 418 and an ethernet port 420. in one embodiment, the backplanes 408 may have six interface slots and may receive up to six option boards. the backplanes 408 may include one or more receptacles 422 configured to receive one or more screws or other fastener to secure an option board, as discussed below. of course, any number of such option board slots may be provided, depending upon the range of options contemplated for the system. fig7 - 10 illustrate various option boards configured to mate with the interface slots 410. it should be appreciated that some embodiments may include options board not illustrated below that include any number of processors, memory, interfaces, inputs and / or outputs. the options boards may provide any desired functionality, including : input and output ; signal conditioning ; isolation ; data conversion ; safety ; analog - to - digital ( a / d ) conversion or other data conversion ; and communication via standard protocols such as devicenet, controlnet, and / or ethernet. as explained further below, various option boards may also include one or more of the following components : processor, fpga, memory, logic registers, clock, terminals, input / output ports, etc. in the presently contemplated embodiment, special option boards may be developed from time to time to address particular system and application needs, to perform particular types of data processing, interfacing with legacy systems, and so forth. for example, beginning with fig7, a first option board 500 may include a processor 502 and an fpga 503. to engage an interface slot 410, the option board 500 may include a bus interface 504. as mentioned above, in one embodiment the bus interface 504 may be a pci - e style connector. additionally, the option board 500 may have one or more connectors 506 or terminals 508 for connection to various inputs and outputs used by the option board 500. to secure the option board 500 to the pod 400, and the receptacles 418, the option board 500 may include one or more screws 510, such as thumbscrews. in some embodiments, other mechanisms may be used to secure the option board 500, such as clips or other fasteners. fig8 depicts another option board 514 also having a bus interface 516 for insertion into the interface slots 410. the option board 514 includes capacitors 518, and a processor or fpga 520. additionally, the option board 514 includes input - output terminals 522, and may include one or more screws 524. fig9 depicts another option board 528 having a bus interface 530 and one or more screws 532 having functions as described above. finally, fig1 illustrates an option board 536 configured to allow use of a legacy option board. for example, the option board 536 includes a legacy board 538 mounted to the option board 536, such as by one or more screws 540. in such an embodiment, the legacy board may connect to the option board 536 via any interface suitable for communication with both the option board 536 and the legacy board 538. the option board 536 may provide any emulation, translation, or other processing necessary for communication with the legacy board 538. the option board 536 may also include a bus interface ( not shown ) for communication with the interface slots 410 and may also include one or more screws 540 to secure the option board 536 to the pod 400. communication from the legacy board 538 may be routed through the option board 526 and the bus interface for communication to the control board. advantageously, the control board backplanes 408 and option boards described above allow connection of option boards without wiring or other internal cable connections. fig1 is a block diagram 600 illustrating the connections between a control board 602 and a plurality of option boards 604. the option boards 604 may be connected to the control board by dedicated dual channel full duplex serial interfaces 606. as discussed above, each option board 604 may include a clock that controls the timing of signaling on the respective serial interface 606. in some embodiments, the control board 602 and option boards 604 may also include a can ( dpi ) channel. as described further below, each channel may carry different signals, such coordinated by an interrupt scheme based on a control event on a first channel 608 and a system event on a second channel 610, and the timing of the signals may be controlled by the clock on the option boards 604. by using the dedicated serial interfaces 606, the control board 602 allows transfer for serial communication of information from the option boards simultaneously and in parallel. additionally, as dictated by the timing of the control event, the data transfer from each option board 604 may be synchronized. as described above, in some embodiments the pod 400 may have two ( or more ) backplanes, as indicated by a dashed regions 612 and 614. in the illustrated embodiment, because each backplane 612 and 614 may include three interface slots, which in one embodiment may be pci - e style connector slots, three dedicated serial buses are provided on each backplane. in addition to communication with the control board 602, the option boards 604 may communicate with each other via a network 616. by using the network 616, the option boards 604 may communicate with each other without first routing the communication through the control board 602. in other embodiments, the option boards 604 may route communication to other options boards on the same backplane or an adjacent backplane via the control board 602. as described above, in a presently contemplated embodiment, each channel of the dual channel full duplex serial interfaces 606 may transmit a specific signal. in this embodiment, the signal processing may be implemented by means of an fpga on the control board 602. in other embodiments the signal processing may be implemented in software and may use a processor on the control board 602. fig1 depicts the signals defining the interrupt scheme in further detail, such as a control event ( ctrl ) signal 700 and a system event ( sys ) signal 702. in one embodiment, the control event signal 700 may be used to coordinate the transfer and collection of data at very short intervals, such as data needed for commutation or generation of the output waveform, while the system event signal 702 may be used to coordinate transfer and collection of less time - critical data, such as multiple types of system level messages, such as general feedback, communications, i / o, and so forth. to ensure synchronization, regardless of the clock timing of each option board, each signal 700 and 702 may have a data acquisition interval and a transfer interval. for example, the control event signal may include a data acquisition window 704 and a transfer interval 706. in one embodiment, the data acquisition window 704 for the control event signal may about 6 s, and the transfer interval may be about 128 s to about 256 s. at the end of the data acquisition window, a processor on the control board is interrupted, e. g., via an irq, to ensure no wasted idle or wait time is consumed by the cpu. by providing a data acquisition window 704, the control board is ensured of receiving all data from the option boards in the pod. thus, in a presently contemplated embodiment, the rising edge 708 of the control event signal, the option boards may shift their register to the control board within the 6 s window. the clock rate of the option boards may be set at the appropriate level to ensure this data is transferred in the data acquisition window. the clock rate may be standardized at 32 mhz, although other rates may be employed. advantageously, this ensures that all registers ( signals ) from the options boards will be synchronized. that is, no matter when each option board acquired its data, all options board must report to the control board by the end of the data acquisition window. in one embodiment, the control event signal may be referred to as a control event primary signal and may be used for control task ( commutation ) data acquisition from the option cards, such as for such data as torque references, encoder feedback, etc. further, to facilitate communication with the serial interface, the option boards may include a shift register interface having a 32 - bit length, and the transfer rate may controlled by a clock on the option board. similarly, in a presently contemplated embodiment, the system event signal 702 may include a data acquisition interval 710 and a transfer interval 712. in such an embodiment, the data acquisition window 710 for the system event signal 702 may be about 20 s and the transfer interval may be about 1 - 2 ms to about 256 s. in some embodiments, the system event signal 702 may provide for both a primary and secondary message sent on the data acquisition interval and transfer interval respectively. in such an embodiment, the secondary message must be completed prior to the end of transfer interval. in one embodiment, the primary message may be referred to as a system event primary and have a 64 byte storage limit, and the secondary message may be referred to as secondary event continuous and have a 512 byte storage limit. it should be noted that the particular speed, data acquisition interval length, interrupt spacing, and so forth used in the drive may be different from that set forth in the present discussion. for example, the timing of the deterministic interrupt scheme is set based upon such factors as the amount of data to be transferred from the option boards ( or from the control circuit to the option boards ), and the duration of the data acquisition interval desired, as compared to the duration of the processing window needed. that is, the processing circuitry of the control board will collect and process the data received, and perform the control functions for operation of the motor coupled to the drive, and will need some time to perform such functions. the data acquisition window may be set to a duration that is a function of the anticipated processing time, such as 10 %. such considerations may result in design choices within the ambit of those skilled in the art. it will be appreciated that the use of dedicated serial interfaces for each functional circuit ( option board ), and the interrupt scheme for transfer and collection of data from all such circuits provides a deterministic, synchronous interrupt structure that permits very fast data transfer rates. the serial interfaces essentially function as bit shift registers for the transfer of data without the need for traffic control between the circuits. similarly, it should be noted that while the rate of transfer of data from the functional circuits may be set, such as at 32 mhz, this rate is actually configurable. thus, where less data is to be delivered in the available time, a slower data transfer rate from the functional circuit may be set ( e. g., as low as 2 mhz ), while for more demanding data transfer, even higher rates may be set ( e. g., 64 mhz ). moreover, the rates of data transfer from the different option boards, even within a single drive, need not be the same. different rates may be set for different option boards, while still maintaining synchronization in operation by virtue of the dedicated serial interfaces and deterministic interrupt scheme. similarly, different data transfer rates may be used for different channels for each board, and these rates may be changed over time. in certain applications the use of different data transfer rates may aid in reducing harmonic distortion or interference between the interfaces and channels. the system event primary may be used for a login function on the serial interface such that each option card may use this signal to log on to the control board and establish communication. the system event primary may be used for system task data acquisition, such as analog i / o, digital i / o, feedback, communications, etc. additionally, in one embodiment the system event continuous signal may provide additional communication such as transfer of large data blocks. to facilitate communication and interfacing of a control board with the option boards, the control board and / or option boards may use profiles to assist with the log on of the option boards. fig1 depicts a process 800 for operation of a control board and option board using a profile in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. initially, upon startup of a motor drive having a backplane with a control board as described above, an installed option board is also powered on ( block 802 ). the option board sends data to the control board during the data acquisition window of the system event signal ( block 804 ), as described above. in response, the control board references a locally stored database ( block 806 ) that may store profiles for the various option boards. the control board reads log on info received in the data from the option board ( block 808 ) that may provide identification information and the state for of option board. the control board then loads the appropriate profile for the option board from the database ( block 810 ) and begins communication with the option board ( block 812 ). in one embodiment, the hmi on a motor drive may provide a user interface for accessing, managing, and configuring the option boards installed in a pod of the motor drive. as mentioned above, the user interface may be provided on a processor and a memory of the control board. in many applications, however, the initial configuration of the drive will be performed by coupling the drive to a workstation, which may include a conventional programmed computer ( e. g., personal computer ). screen views provided by software on the workstation, or served by the drive to the workstation facilitate in selecting parameter settings, units of measure, parameter names, and so forth. the profile for each option board, moreover, greatly facilitates this process, and each profile may already preconfigure certain of the settings for the option board, or may reduce the set of options presented to the installer or system integrator to those available or appropriate to that option board and selected system setup. the profiles may thus be part of an automatic device configuration scheme, streamlining setup of the drives by reducing the information presented to the installer and guiding the installer though the setup. it is presently contemplated that such individual profiles may be stored on the option boards ( i. e., each option board including its respective profile ), and fed to the control board, or a library of profiles may be stored on the control board, and an appropriate profile used for configuration of a specific option board if it is recognized as present in the drive by the control board. such profiles may also be downloaded to the drive from a library, such as via the network connection provided to the drive, or upon initial installation. certain of these options may allow for expansion of the number and types of functional circuits available over time. it should be noted that in another presently contemplated implementation, the profile data ( defining functions of the functional circuits, parameters they provide or need for operation, rates of transfer of data, etc. ) may be provided ( e. g., uploaded ) directly from the functional circuits to the control circuit without reference to a database or library or profiles. this approach essentially relies on storage of the profile data in the functional circuitry and loading or transfer of the data to the control circuit. however, this approach may prove more generic insomuch as additional functional circuits may be developed over time, and these may self - configure the control circuitry which would need no prior information or data relating to the profile or to the functional circuit. fig1 and 15 depict screenshots of such a user interface in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. fig1 depicts a first screen 900 having a left hand navigation pane 902 and a right hand parameter pane 904. as illustrated in fig1, the navigation pane 902 includes list of the control boards and associated option boards for a motor drive. the control boards may be listed as nodes in the navigation pane and may include any number of collapsible parameters and device underneath. for example, a first node 908 ( node 1 ) corresponds to the powerflex 755 control board. underneath the first node 908 various parameters 910 are listed. the option boards 912 may also be listed underneath the first node 908. in one embodiment, the option boards 912 may be arranged according to the interface slots occupied by the option board. for example, a first option board 914 ( lcd module ) may be listed in slot 1, a second option board 916 ( 20 - comm - e - ethernet / ip ) may be listed in slot 2, etc. by selecting a node 908, e. g., a control board 908, or an option board 912, a user may display the parameters associated with that control board or option board. for example, the right hand pane 904 a list of parameters is displayed, such as the speed parameters 914. the right hand pane 904 may display information about each item listed, including a node column 916, a slot column 918, and a parameter number 920, with each column displaying the node, slot and parameter respectively of each item. to configure a node, a user may select a parameter, as illustrated by the selected parameter 922 ( speed ref a set, e. g., a speed reference ). as shown in fig1, the second screen 924 illustrates a pop - up window 926 that displays after selection of a parameter. the pop - up window 926 corresponds to the selected parameter 922 and provides a number of selections. as shown, a first tab 928 ( list selection ) displays the port 930, the parameter 938, the value 940 and the internal value 942. additionally, a minimum value 944, a maximum value 946, and a default value 948 may also be set. the port 930 may display a drop down box corresponding to the port or slot selectable by the user. to configure the parameter 922 for a specific port, a user may select the port from the drop down menu 950, such as selecting port ( node ) 0, port 4, port 5, etc. after the port 930 is selected, the parameter 938 may be configured by entering a new value. additional tabs in the pop - window 926 may include additional functionality, such as a numeric edit tab 952 and an advanced tab 954. the numeric edit tab 952 may allow direct editing of numeric parameters, and the advanced tab 954 may include additional configuration operations for the selected parameter 922. in this manner, a user may configure of any option boards coupled to the backplane of a motor drive. it should be noted that any number of drives may be configured in a similar manner, particularly where numerous drives are networked together in a system. thus, the system integrator may navigate to a specific drive for its configuration, then to other drives for configuration of the overall system. the interrupt scheme described above permits synchronization of all functions within the motor drive, including the acquisition of data from all functional circuits supported on the option boards. that is, because all data is received serially from all of the option board functional circuits and in response to the command and system interrupts, all of the data is assured of being received by the control circuitry at the same time. once received, the data can be acted upon by the processing capabilities of the control circuitry in the interim between interrupts. for data that directly affects motor control, sometimes referred to as communication data, the data acquisition is particularly fast, with little time between the interrupts. for other data, the intervals may be more widely spaced in time. the same interrupt scheme, and close synchronization of data acquisition can also allow for very accurate synchronization between drives linked to one another via a network. for example, fig1 illustrates a system 1000 in which two motor drives 1002 and 1004 are interconnected to maintain synchronization. drive 1002 includes a control circuit 1006 of the type described above, coupled to functional circuits 1008. as in the embodiments described above, the control circuit will typically be supported separately from the functional circuits, such as on a control board, while the functional circuits are supported on option boards. the number and type of such option boards may vary depending upon the system requirements, the type of control to be performed, and so forth. also as described above, the control circuit communicates with the functional circuits via dedicated serial interfaces, and coordinates the transfer and collection of data from the functional circuits by interrupts, thus maintaining precise synchronization of all drive operations down to the option board level. the control circuit utilizes data collected from the functional circuits to provide control signals to drive circuit 1010, which powers solid state switches to produce output power for a motor 1012, as described above. drive 1004 is similarly configured. it includes a control circuit 1014 and a series of functional circuits 1016 that communicate with the control circuit 1014 via dedicated serial interfaces, with data transfer again being coordinated via interrupts as described above. the control circuit 1018 similarly produces control signals that are applied to drive circuit 1018 for driving motor 1020. in system 1000, the operation of motors 1012 and 1020 is coordinated and synchronized, such as for multi - axis control. such coordinated control is extremely useful in many applications, such as integrated machines in which motors handle product in continuous processes. examples may include printing applications, paper making applications, product handling applications, and so forth, to mention only a few. to permit such high degree of synchronization, a synchronization counter 1022, or similar device, is included in each drive, and synchronizes the clock of the control circuit for that drive with that of other drives interconnected in the system. in a presently contemplated embodiment, the drives are interconnected via a network connection 1024, which utilizes an ethernet communications protocol, although other protocols may be used. the coordination of the synchronization counters is performed in accordance with ieee 1588 standards. it has been found that the use of such clock synchronization between drives, in conjunction with the use of dedicated serial interfaces for functional circuits, and the interrupt scheme for transfer and collection of data from the functional circuits permits an unprecedented degree of coordination and synchronization of the drives. that is, in the overall system, all functional circuits ( e. g., input / output circuits, communications circuits, encoders, parameter estimation / calculation circuits, etc. ) of all drives can be precisely coordinated insomuch as the interrupts for transfer and collection of data from all such circuits occurs at the same time, as coordinated by synchronization of the clocks of all drives. such coordination allows the drives to be used in applications and with a degree of precision that was heretofore unavailable in similar production equipment. it should also be noted that, as mentioned above, the use of dedicated serial data interfaces for the functional circuits, and the interrupt structure described above also permits sending and receiving synchronized messages between the control circuitry and the functional circuits. that is, during an interrupt, a rising edge is used to start a message transfer between the control and functional circuits. this may be referred to as the primary message transfer. in addition to this message transfer, however, a secondary message transfer may be implemented between the control and functional circuits. this may occur when the interrupt ends ( returns to a low state, i. e., a falling edge is detected ). in a presently contemplated implementation, this secondary transfer occurs after the initial 6 s or 20 s timing interval ( or any other interrupt interval employed ) until the next periodic interrupt. this secondary message transfer allows for further utilization of the serial transfer bandwidth. while only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. it is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.","in one embodiment , a motor drive is provided that includes a control board and an option board coupled to the control board via a serial interface , wherein the option board includes

104, a health care system, a patient interface 108, and an interaction based gamification system 110. in the example system shown in fig1, the user device 104, the health care system 106, the patient portal 108, and the interaction based gamification system 110 are coupled to each other through the computer - readable medium 102. as used in this paper, a computer - readable medium is intended to include all mediums that are statutory ( e. g., in the united states, under 35 u. s. c. 101 ), and to specifically exclude all mediums that are non - statutory in nature to the extent that the exclusion is necessary for a claim that includes the computer - readable medium to be valid. known statutory computer - readable mediums include hardware ( e. g., registers, random access memory ( ram ), non - volatile ( nv ) storage, to name a few ), but may or may not be limited to hardware. the computer - readable medium 102 is intended to represent a variety of potentially applicable technologies. for example, the computer - readable medium 102 can be used to form a network or part of a network. where two components are co - located on a device, the computer - readable medium 102 can include a bus or other data conduit or plane. where a first component is co - located on one device and a second component is located on a different device, the computer - readable medium 102 can

implemented as a computer system, a plurality of computer systems, or parts of a computer system or a plurality of computer systems. in general, a computer system will include a processor, memory, non - volatile storage, and an interface. a typical computer system will usually include at least a processor, memory, and a device ( e. g., a bus ) coupling the memory to the processor. the processor can be, for example, a general - purpose central processing unit ( cpu ), such as a microprocessor, or a special - purpose processor, such as a microcontroller. the memory can include, by way of example but not limitation, random access memory ( ram ), such as dynamic ram ( dram ) and static ram ( sram ). the memory can be local, remote, or distributed. the bus can also couple the processor to non -

magnetic or optical card, or another form of storage for large amounts of data. some of this data is often written, by a direct memory access process, into memory during execution of software on the computer system. the non - volatile storage can be local, remote, or distributed. the non - volatile storage is optional because systems can be created with all applicable data available in memory. software is typically stored in the non - volatile storage. indeed, for large programs, it may not even be possible to store the entire program in the memory. nevertheless, it should be understood that for software to run, if necessary, it is moved to a computer - readable location appropriate for processing, and for illustrative purposes, that location is referred to as the memory in this paper. even when software is moved to the memory for execution, the processor will typically make use of hardware registers to store values associated with the software, and local cache that, ideally, serves to speed up execution. as used herein, a software program is assumed to be stored at an applicable known or convenient location ( from non - volatile storage to hardware registers ) when the software program is referred to as implemented in a computer - readable storage medium. a processor is considered to be configured to execute a program when at least one value associated with the program is stored in a register readable by the processor. in one example of operation, a computer system can be controlled by operating system software, which is a software program that includes a file management system, such as a disk operating system. one example of operating system software with associated file management system software is the family of operating systems known as windows from microsoft corporation of redmond, wash., and their associated file management systems. another example of operating system software with its associated file management system software is the linux operating system and its associated file management system. the file management system is typically stored in the non - volatile storage and causes the processor to execute the various acts required by the operating system to input and output data and to store data in the memory, including storing files on the non - volatile storage. the bus can also couple the processor to the interface. the interface can include one or more input and / or output ( i / o ) devices. the i / o devices can include, by way of example but not limitation, a keyboard, a mouse or other pointing device, disk drives, printers, a scanner, and other i / o devices, including a display device. the display device can include, by way of example but not limitation, a cathode ray tube ( crt ), liquid crystal display ( lcd ), or some other applicable known or convenient display device. the interface can include one or more of a modem or network interface. it will be appreciated that a modem or network interface can be considered to be part of the computer system. the interface can include an analog modem, isdn modem, cable modem, token ring interface, satellite transmission interface ( e. g. direct pc ), or other interfaces for coupling a computer system to other computer systems. interfaces enable computer systems and other devices to be coupled together in a network. the computer systems can be compatible with or implemented as part of or through a cloud - based computing system. as used in this paper, a cloud - based computing system is a system that provides virtualized computing resources, software and / or information to client devices. the computing resources, software and / or information can be virtualized by maintaining centralized services and resources that

includes one or more processors or a portion thereof. a portion of one or more processors can include some portion of hardware less than all of the hardware comprising any given one or more processors, such as a subset of registers, the portion of the processor dedicated to one or more threads of a multi - threaded processor, a time slice during which the processor is wholly or partially dedicated to carrying out part of the engine & # 39 ; s functionality, or the like. as such, a first engine and a second engine can have one or more dedicated processors, or a first engine and a second engine can share one or more processors with one another or other engines. depending upon implementation - specific or other considerations, an engine can be centralized or its functionality

software embodied in a physical computer - readable medium on a general - or specific - purpose machine, in firmware, in hardware, in a combination thereof, or in an applicable known or convenient device or system. datastore - associated components, such as database interfaces, can be considered part of a datastore, part of some other system component, or a combination thereof, though the physical location and other characteristics of datastore - associated components is not critical for an understanding of the techniques described in this paper. datastores can include data structures. as used in this paper, a data structure is associated with a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently within a given context. data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by an address, a bit string that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. thus, some data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations ; while other data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. many data structures use both principles, sometimes combined in non - trivial ways. the implementation of a data structure usually entails writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. the datastores, described in this paper, can be cloud - based datastores. a cloud - based datastore is a datastore that is compatible with cloud - based

modulation display systems. in one embodiment, light source models are developed and used to advantageous effect. camera pictures of displayed images of known input images may be evaluated to improve light models. in some embodiments, an iterative process may accumulate improvements. in some embodiments, these techniques may be used on moving images to make live adjustments to improve image rendering performance dual modulation projector and display systems have been described in commonly - owned patents and patent applications, including : ( 1 ) u. s. pat. no. 8, 125, 702 to ward et al., issued on feb. 28, 2012 and entitled serial modulation display having binary light modulation stage ; ( 2 ) united states patent application 20130148037 to whitehead et al., published on jun. 13, 2013 and entitled projection displays ; ( 3 ) united states patent application 20110227900 to wallener, published on sep. 22, 2011 and entitled custom psfs using clustered light sources ; ( 4 ) united states patent application 20130106923 to shields et al., published on may 2, 2013 and entitled systems and methods for accurately representing high contrast imagery on high dynamic range display systems ; ( 5 ) united states patent application 20110279749 to erinjippurath et al., published on nov. 17, 2011 and entitled high dynamic range displays using filterless lcd ( s ) for increasing contrast and resolution and ( 6 ) united states patent application 20120133689 to kwong, published on may 31, 2012 and entitled reflectors with spatially varying reflectance / absorption gradients for color and luminance compensation. all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. fig1 shows one possible embodiment of a suitable image projector display system. in this embodiment, the projector display system is constructed as a dual / multi - modulator projector display system 100 that may suffice for the purposes of the present application. projector system 100 employs a light source 102 that supplies the projector system with a desired illumination such that a final projected image will be sufficiently bright for the intended viewers of the projected image. light source 102 may comprise any suitable light source possible including, but not limited to : xenon lamp, laser ( s ), coherent light source, partially coherent light sources. as the light source is a major draw of power and / or energy for the entire projector system, it may be desirable to advantageously use and / or re - use the light, so as to conserve the power and / or energy during the course of its operation. light 104 may illuminate a first modulator 106 that may, in turn, illuminate a second modulator 110, via a set of optional optical components 108. light from second modulator 110 may be projected by a projection lens 112 ( or other suitable optical components ) to form a final projected image upon a screen 114. first and second modulators may be controlled by a controller 116 which may receive input image and / or video data. controller 116 may perform certain image processing algorithms, gamut mapping algorithms or other such suitable processing upon the input image / video data and output control / data signals to first and second modulators in order to achieve a desired final projected image 114. in addition, in some projector systems, it may be possible, depending on the light source, to modulate light source 102 ( control line not shown ) in order to achieve additional control of the image quality of the final projected image. light recycling module 103 is depicted in fig1 as a dotted box that may be placed in the light path from the light source 102 to the first modulator 106, as will be discussed below. while the present discussion will be given in the context of this positioning, it will be appreciated that light recycling may be inserted into the projector system at various points in the projector system. for example, light recycling may be placed between the first and second modulators. in addition, light recycling may be placed at more than one point in the optical path of the display system. while such embodiments may be more expensive due to an increase in the number of components, that increase may be balanced off against the energy cost savings as a result of multiple points of light recycling. while the embodiment of fig1 is presented in the context of a dual, multi - modulation projection system, it should be appreciated that the techniques and methods of the present application will find application in single modulation, or other dual, multi - modulation display systems. for example, a dual modulation display system comprising a backlight, a first modulator ( e. g., lcd or the like ), and a second modulator ( e. g., lcd or the like ) may employ suitable blurring optical components and image processing methods and techniques to affect the performance and efficiencies discussed herein in the context of the projection systems. it should also be appreciated that even though fig1 depicts a two - stage or dual modulator display system the methods and techniques of the present application may also find application in a display system with only one modulator or a display system with three or more modulator ( multi - modulator ) display systems. the scope of the present application encompasses these various alternative embodiments. fig2 depicts one embodiment of a projector system, as may be suitable for the purposes of the present application. a light conduit subsystem / module ( e. g., comprising one or more components from 201 to 216 ) may be placed in the projector system primarily between the light source 102 and a first modulator 221. light from light source 102 may be input to the optical path via an integrating rod / tube / box 202. in one embodiment, integrating rod / tube / box 202 may comprise a substantially reflected surface in its interior, so that light that is incident on its surface may be reflected ( e. g., possibly multiple times ) until the light exits its extreme right end 203. once the light exits the integrating rod / tube / box, the light may be placed into an optical path that is defined by a set of optical elements e. g., lens 204, 214 and 216 and a set of filters and / or polarizers 206, 208, 210 and 212. this embodiment may also be constructed to perform light recycling, if desired for the design of this projector system. first modulator 221 may comprise a number of prisms 218 a, 218 b and a reflector 220. reflector 220 may comprise a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) array of reflectors, or a micro - electro - mechanical system ( mems ) array or any other suitable set of reflectors possible that may reflect light in at least two or more paths. one such path is depicted in fig2. as may be seen, reflectors 220 direct the light onto the interface of prisms 218 a and 218 b, such that the light may be thereby reflected into lens assembly 222 and thereafter to second modulator 229 ( e. g., comprising lens assembly 224, prisms 226 and 230 and reflector 228 ). this light may be employed to form the finally projected image to be viewed by an audience. however, at certain time during the rendering of the final projected image, the full power / energy of the light source 102 may not be needed. if it is not possible to modulate the power of light source 102, then it may be desired to recycle the light from light source 102. additionally, it may be desired to increase the brightness of highlights in an image and light recycled in the projector system may provide additional power. in such a case, and as may be seen in fig2, it may be possible to align reflector 220 from its current position as shown ( i. e., where the light is directed to travel the path down to the second modulator to position instead where the light would be substantially reflected back to the integrating rod / tube / box 202, along substantially the same path as described as traveling from right - to - left direction. in another embodiment, a third optional path ( not shown ) allows the reflectors to direct light from the light source to a light dump i. e., a portion of the projector system where the light is absorbed. in this case, the light is wasted as heat to be dissipated from the projector system. thus, the projector system may have multiple degrees of freedom when it comes to directing the light as desired. fig3 is yet another embodiment of a portion of a projector system 300 which may serve to transmit light from at least one laser and / or partially coherent colored light source and ports ( e. g., through fiber launch 302, collimator 304, diffuser 306 ). light from such a source may transmit through a first optical subsystem / diffuser relay 308 to condition the light to be input into integrating rod 312 which may comprise the reflecting proximal end 310 ( e. g., recycling mirror ). a second optical subsystem / recycling relay 314 may further condition the light as desired prior to input into a first modulator 316. as with fig2 above, this first leg of the system 300 may affect a light recycling mode, as discussed. after first modulation, light may be transmitted through a third optical subsystem / point spread function ( psf ) relay 318 prior to input into a second modulator 320 which modulates the light for transmission through a projector optical subsystem 322 to project a final image for viewing. in continued reference to fig3, there is shown a relay optical system 318 that is placed in between a first modulator 316 ( e. g., a pre - modulator ) and a second modulator 320 ( e. g., a primary modulator / nine piece prism ). such a relay optical system may be desirable to both reduce the amount of artifacts in the image processing as well as increasing the contrast of the projected image. as discussed herein in the context of one embodiment, it may be desirable for the first modulator / pre - modulator to produce a blurred and / or de - focused image based upon image data values, e. g., such as a halftone image. in many embodiments, it may be desirable to have a relay optical system that tends to produce a uniformly blurred / de - focused image from the pre - modulator to the primary modulator. in addition, it may be desirable to have a desired, defocused spot shape for this embodiment. in many embodiments, the relay optical system may comprise lenses or other optical elements that effectively moves the focal plane, corrects for any coma, and adjusts the spread ( e. g., by creating defocus / blur and adding spherical aberration to some desired amount ). as discussed above, it may be desirable to improve the efficiency of these projector systems, both in terms of energy efficiency and / or in terms of cost efficiency. one such area for improvement may be made in the area of the input prism assembly, e. g., as employed in conjunction with a spatial light modulator ( slm ) such as a dmd and / or mems array as described herein. fig4 a through 4c depict a conventional prism assembly in front view, top view and side view, respectively. in operation, fig5 a through 5d depict how the prism assembly may interact with an input light beam, reflect the light beam off the dmd in on state, off state and flat state orientations of the dmd reflectors, respectively. as may be seen in fig4 a through 4c and fig5 a through 5d, an input light beam 502 may be transmitted through first prism 408 and totally internally reflected ( tir ) at the interface with second prism 406, transmitted through optical glasses 404 and 400 which is disposed proximal to dmd array 500 ( depicted as light beam 504 ). as depicted in fig5 b, when the dmd reflector is set to on state, reflected light beam 506 may be transmitted back through optical elements 400, 404, 408 and 406 to provide light for further modulation and / or projection. fig5 c depicts the light beam 508, as may be reflected when the dmd reflector is set to the off state e. g., whereby light beam 508 may be directed to a light dump ( not shown ), to be absorbed and / or disposed of, so as not to affect the dynamic range of the display. fig5 d depicts light beam 510 when the dmd reflectors are in a flat state orientation. as with light reflected from the dmd in the off state, light reflected during the flat state should similarly be directed away from an operative downstream light path which might include further modulation and / or projection. when the light source is high powered, such as high powered white light ( e. g. xenon lamp or the like ) or high powered colored laser light, then heat may present undesired thermal effects that may manifest themselves in either undesirable imaging effects and / or mechanical element degradation. undesirable effects may include change in psf shape and / or size and positional drift of image from pre - mod to primary modulator over time and heat cycling. fig6 a through 6d show one embodiment of a prism assembly as made in accordance with the principles of the present application given a front view, top view, side view and bottom view, respectively. as may be seen, the present prism assembly comprises optical elements 600, 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614 and 616. in this embodiment, optical elements may be employed to operate on one or more color channels making separate color channel prism paths for each separate color light that is received by the prism assembly. for example, in the green channel as one of the separate color channel prism paths, optical element 602 is a green dump wedge, optical element 612 is a green wedge and optical element 600 is a green input wedge. in the blue channel, optical element 608 is a blue input wedge, optical element 610 is a blue dump wedge and optical element 616 is a blue wedge. in the red channel, optical element 606 is a red dump wedge, optical element 614 is a red wedge and optical element 604 is a red input wedge. it should be noted that each color channel has a number of optical elements deployed for the processing of the colored light input. it should be appreciated that while one embodiment may take in separate colored light input ( e. g., from lasers, leds, partially coherent light sources or the like ), other embodiments may take in white light input ( e. g., from xenon lamp or the like ). in such embodiments, it may be possible to separate the various color components from the white light prior to prism assembly ( e. g., with another, initial, prism assembly or the like ) and then process the separate color components with the prism assembly as made in accordance with the principles of the present application. in operation, fig7 a through 7d depict the manner in which input light beams would be processed by the prism assembly of the present application. fig7 a depicts the situation where a beam of green light ( e. g., from white light, green laser light and / or partially coherent green light ) is input into the system ( as beam 702 ). beam 702 reflects off the surface of wedge 600 as shown and transmitted to the dmd reflector 700 ( as beam 704 ). fig7 b depicts the reflected beam 708 when the dmd reflector is set in the on state. beam 708 is transmitted through the green wedge 612 for further modulation and / or projection. fig7 c depicts the reflected beam 708 when the dmd reflector is set in the off state. beam 708 is transmitted through the green dump wedge 602 to prevent further modulation and / or projection. fig7 d depicts the reflected beam 708 when the dmd reflector is set in the flat state. beam 708 is again transmitted through the green dump wedge 602 to again prevent further modulation and / or projection. as mentioned above, today & # 39 ; s projector systems are illuminated with higher power light sources. such light sources may include xenon white lamps, high powered colored lasers, and / or high powered partially coherent light sources. the performance of such prior art prism designs may not be desirable for many reasons in high powered image projector display system. for merely one example, fig8 depicts the thermal load of the conventional prism ( e. g., same or similar prism as shown as fig4 a through 4c ). as may be seen, the thermal loads in the legend proceed from lowest to highest as : 1 ( 802 ), 2 ( 804 ), 3 ( 806 ), 4 ( 808 ) and 6 ( 810 ). as may be seen the prior art prism under full illumination purports to have many regions of high thermal load as noted. by contrast, fig9 depicts the thermal loading of the 9 - piece prism arrangement of fig6 a through 6d, and other embodiments as made in accordance with the principles of the present application. in this embodiment, as the prism assembly may input separate, discrete color channels of illumination, it may be seen that the thermal loading of this prism assembly is better distributed. ( 1 ) significantly simplified dichroic coatings ( 2 ) single pass at single nominal angle unlike current 3 - chip prisms.

"broadly, this invention is a 2d image alignment algorithm which is augmented to three dimensions by introducing the depth maps of the images. the method provides an ideal way to extend the existing matching framework to handle general 3d camera motion, allowing one to directly solve for the extrinsic parameters of the camera and localize it within its environment. for the purpose of explaining the method in a very concrete fashion, discussion shall focus on a situation similar to that used in guided bronchoscopy. in a typical bronchoscopic procedure, a ct scan is initially performed and can subsequently be processed to extract the airway tree surfaces. the interior of the hollow airway tree constitutes the known environment. during bronchoscopy, the bronchoscope is inserted into the airways and a camera mounted on the tip transmits in real - time a sequence of real bronchoscopic ( rb ) video images. assuming that the calibration parameters of the endoscope are known, virtual bronchoscopic ( vb ) images ( endoluminal renderings ) can be rendered at arbitrary viewpoints within the airway tree. it is also clear that the depths corresponding to each pixel of the vb image can be immediately calculated and form a virtual depth map ( vdm ). the problem is that we have a fixed real - time rb image from an unknown location within the interior of an airway, but we also have a known vb source with known location and 3d information that enables us to create manifestations of the same hollow airway structure from arbitrary viewpoint. given the above setup, the goal is to locate the source of the rb image by attempting to find the best match between that fixed rb image and any possible vb endoluminal rendering. a fairly straightforward approach to accomplish this is by employing a gauss - newton gradient descent algorithm that attempts to minimize a difference measure between the rb image and the vb image with respect to the viewing parameters ( i. e., viewpoint ) of the virtual image. the method for doing this is similar to the lucas - kanade image alignment algorithm [ 5 ]. the objective function used in [ 5, 6 ] is the sum squared difference ( ssd ) between the pixel intensities of the two images, although weighted ssd is equally viable, and weighted or unweighted normalized cross - correlation ( cc ) can be used if some additional weak assumptions are made. using the ssd, the objective function can thus be written as e = u, v [ i v ( u, v ; p + p ) - i r ( u, v ) ] 2 ( 1 ) where p is the vector of viewing parameters, i v ( u, v ; p + p ) is the virtual vb image rendered from the viewpoint p + p, u and v are the row and column indices, and i r is the real rb image. following the procedure of [ 5 ], it is shown that that the gauss - newton parameter update p can be found as p = h - 1 u, v [ i p ] [ i v ( u, v ; p ) - i r ( u, v ) ] ( 2 ) h = u, v [ i v p ] u, v ; p t [ i v p ] u, v ; p ( 3 ) [ i v p ] ( u, v ; p ) is a vector that gives the change in the intensity of a pixel ( u, v ) in a vb image i v rendered at viewpoint p with respect to each of the components of the parameter vector p. can also be interpreted as a vector of steepest descent images, where each component of the vector is actually an image that describes the variation of the image intensities with respect a component of the parameter vector. because the steepest descent images change at every viewpoint p, they, and the hessian must be recomputed every iteration, leading to a very computationally costly algorithm. to speed up the iteration, the inverse compositional algorithm was proposed [ 6 ]. under this strategy, instead of moving the virtual viewpoint towards the real viewpoint using the parameter update, we instead move the real viewpoint toward the virtual viewpoint using the inverse of the parameter update. since the computer obviously has no control over the location of the bronchoscope tip, this may seem to be an unfeasible strategy. however, using a depth - based warping, the rb image can be warped to simulate its appearance from other viewpoints. this strategy results in comparing a warped version of the real image to a stationary virtual image. under this formulation, the objective function we seek to minimize is : e = u, v [ i v ( u, v ; p ) - i r ( w ( u, v, z r ; p ) ) ] 2 ( 4 ) the warping function w (. ) warps the image coordinates of the rb image i r and hence warps the image itself. it is important also to note that the warp in this case is dependent on the depth map of the real image z r. solving for the gauss - newton parameter update associated with 4 yields p = h - 1 | p = 0 - & gt ; u, v [ i p ] u, v ; 0 - & gt ; [ i r ( w ( u, v, z r ; p ) ) - i v ( u, v ) ] ( 5 ) while this may seem to add unnecessary complexity and error to the problem, it actually serves to greatly speed the iteration and has the additional side benefit of eliminating the need to render arbitrary viewpoints on the fly if you instead have a collection of pre - rendered ( or pre - captured ) images and corresponding depth maps. the reason for this significant increase in speed is that the vb image and vb image gradients are always evaluated at p = 0, the reference viewing site, and as such allows all of the following operations to be pre - computed before iteration begins : 1. the known environment is sampled as a set of viewing sites. 2. virtual images i v are pre - rendered at each viewing site. 3. virtual depth maps z v are computed at each site. are computed with respect to each of the viewing parameters in vector p. 5. the inverse hessian h 1 is gauss - newton estimated from the steepest descent images the iterative portion of the algorithm may then be carried out in the following steps : 1. warp the real image from pose p to the nearest reference site. 2. compute the error image i r ( w ( u, v, z r ; p ) ) i v ( u, v ; { right arrow over ( 0 ) } ). 4. find the new values of p by incrementing the old parameters by the inverse of the update ( p ) 1. these steps are illustrated in fig1. ignoring the warp function, all the equations presented thus far are general and can apply equally well to 2d transformations, such as affine or homography, or 3d rotations. the focus is now narrowed, however, to the full 3d motion case with our choice of coordinate system and parameters. one may realize from inspection of the warps in ( 4 ) that the problem is defined in terms of several local coordinate systems as each reference view is defined to be at p = { right arrow over ( 0 ) }, yielding a different coordinate system for each viewing site used. it is, however, a trivial matter to relate each of these coordinate systems to a global coordinate frame in order to perform parameter conversions between frames. therefore, given a camera pose with respect to the global camera frame, we can define our parameter vector as with three euler rotation angles and three translations with respect to the nearest reference view. with this parameterization, the warping w ( u, v, z ; p ) is governed by the matrix equation [ u z f v z f z ] = r [ uz f vz f z ] + [ t x t y t z ] ( 7 ) where r is the rotation matrix defined by the euler angles ( r, p, y ), u and v are the columns and rows of the image, f is the focal length, and z is the entry on the depth map z corresponding to the point ( u, v ). here ( u, v ) gives the warped image coordinate of interest, and z gives the warped depth corresponding to that point. note that in the problem statement, we assume only that the virtual depth map z v is known. however, when using the inverse compositional algorithm, the warp is applied to the real image i r and the real depth map z r must first be calculated by warping the virtual depth map z v to the current estimated pose of the real camera via p. this can also be performed using ( 7 ) and then interpolating the resulting warped depth map onto the coordinate system of the real image. in doing so, we are implicitly assuming that our estimate of p is relatively close to its actual value. if this is not the case, the parameter error can lead to large errors in the real depth map z r, and therefore large errors in the image warping. under such circumstances, the forward gradient descent method governed by ( 1 - 2 ) may be better suited to the problem. in order to apply the warping function, at each pixel coordinate ( u, v ), with intensity i ( u, v ) and depth z ( u, v ), a new coordinate ( u, v ) and depth z ( u, v ) are found via ( 7 ). the original intensities and depths may then be mapped onto the new image array i ( u, v ). some special care must be taken when performing the warping. firstly, the image difference in ( 4 ) requires that the coordinate locations be the same for both images. the resultant array must therefore be interpolated onto the same coordinate grid as the original arrays. because of this interpolation, and because the depth - based warping may result in occlusion, it can be difficult to choose the proper intensity corresponding to an output pixel. this can be mitigated somewhat if the intensities corresponding to larger depths are discarded when they overlap with those of smaller depths. there are several ways to generate the steepest descent images. they may be generated numerically by taking the difference of the reference images warped to small positive and negative values of each parameter. they may also be generated analytically by expanding the derivative via the chain rule : i p = [ u i v i ] j p ( 8 ) where u i and u i are the image gradients with respect to the rows and columns of the image, and j p is the jacobian of the warped coordinates with respect to p and thus can be found by differentiating u and v from ( 7 ) with respect to each of the warp parameters and evaluating it at a particular current value of p. in the case of the inverse compositional algorithm, the image derivatives are always evaluated at p = { right arrow over ( 0 ) } and thus the jacobian is constant for each reference viewing site : j p = [ - v - uv f - f - u 2 f f z 0 - u z - u - f - v 2 f - vu f 0 f z - v z ] ( 9 ) we now have all the necessary information to calculate the iterated parameter update p. the final step is to invert this update, and compose it with the current estimate of p. the euler angles can be found from the rotation matrix resulting from where r d is the incremental rotation matrix associated with the rotation angles in p. the updated translations can be found from ( t x l t y l t z l ) = ( t x t y t z ) - rr d t ( t x t y t z ) ( 11 ) where t i are the translation elements of the parameter update p. in order to improve the performance when applying the above approach, several optimizing techniques are used. operations performed on full - resolution images can be very computationally intensive. therefore, a resolution pyramid is used wherein all images, depth maps, and gradients are down - sampled, preferably by a factor of 4, at each level. as we are not particularly concerned with computation time regarding the precomputed virtual views and gradients, and most video capture hardware provides real - time hardware subsampling for the real image, the computational cost of this subsampling is inconsequential and provides much quicker iteration times. when implementing the above registration algorithm using pyramid decomposition, the algorithm is begun at the lowest resolution level of the pyramid ( experimental results in this paper were performed starting at level 3 ; i. e., a factor of 64 reduction in resolution ) and run until a reasonable stopping criteria was met before proceeding to a higher resolution level. this pyramidal approach not only speeds computation, it also serves to prevent convergence to local optima, because only the largest features are present in the highly subsampled images, while sharper features are introduced in higher resolution levels to aid in fine adjustment. a second optimization that is used in practice is the use of the weighted normalized cross - correlation objective function e = - u, v w u, v [ i v ( w ( u, v, z ; p ) ) - 0 v ] [ i r ( w ( u, v, z ; p ) ) - r r ] ( 12 ) that allows images of different mean intensities and intensity ranges to be compared and also allows weighting of individual pixel values. it should be noted that in order to use this objective function under the inverse compositional algorithm, the weights must be constant and they must be chosen prior to the computation of the steepest descent images ( i. e. they must be based off features of the virtual images ). taking advantage of the equivalence of normalized ssd and normalized cross - correlation, the update can be found as : p = h - 1 p = 0 u, v w u, v [ i p ] _ p = 0 t [ i _ r ( w ( u, v, z ; p ) ) - i _ v ( u, v ) ] ( 13 ) h = u, v w u, v [ i p ] _ t [ i p ] _, ( 14 ) is the set of mean - subtracted steepest descent images divided by the variance of the virtual image i v, and i i i are the normalized images. to validate the algorithm, sample results for the virtual - to - real and virtual - to - virtual registration cases are given. in both of the cases outlined below, the virtual environment is a ct chest scan of a human patient designated h005. the airway surfaces were automatically generated using the methods of kiraly et al. [ 10 ]. airway centerlines were extracted using the methods of swift et al. and the virtual viewing sites were chosen along these airway centerlines at intervals varying between 0. 3 mm and 1 mm, with the viewing direction chosen parallel to the airway centerline [ 11 ]. virtual images and depth maps were generated by an opengl renderer assuming a spot light source at the camera focal point, a field of view of 78. 2 degrees and a 264 264 image size to match the calibration parameters of the bronchoscope camera. the virtual - to - real registration was performed using pyramid decomposition starting from level 3 and ending at level 1. to account for the difference in intensity characteristics between the imaging sources, the weighted normalized cross - correlation ( 12 ) was used as the objective function, with weights w u, v chosen as in order to emphasize dark areas, which tend to have more information in bronchoscopic video. the video frame, taken from a bronchoscopic procedure performed on h005 was first processed to remove the geometric barrel distortion from the lens to obtain the real image i r. in the virtual - to - real registration case, it is difficult to give ground truth locations as the location of the scope tip is in practice unknown. without external localization, the quality of a good registration is somewhat qualitative in nature. fig2 shows a sample of the registration results, with edges from the virtual image overlaid on the unregistered and registered real views. the results show that the alignment is qualitatively very satisfying. in the virtual - to - virtual registration case, the real image is actually a rendering generated at a specified location in the airway, but with all depth information discarded. the algorithm uses pyramid decomposition starting from level 3 and ending at level 1, and the weighted ssd objective function was used where the weights w u, v were chosen as in ( 15 ) as before. fig3 shows the real image i r prior to registration, the virtual image i v at the nearest reference site and the warped real image i r ( w ( u, v, z ; p ) ) after registration is complete. x y position position z position viewpoint ( mm ) ( mm ) ( mm ) ( deg ) ( deg ) ( deg ) initial 147. 5 149. 2 71. 1 20. 2 1. 7 0 reference 146. 7 149. 4 73. 3 7. 3 5. 1 19. 9 site registered 147. 6 149. 0 73. 9 20. 9 1. 2 3. 2 ground 147. 1 148. 9 73. 8 20. 24 1. 8 0. 4 truth error 0. 6 0. 1 0. 5 0. 7 3. 0 2. 8 at least four different alternatives are available for registering the real and virtual sources in the case of bronchoscopy. these scenarios are outlined below : 1. virtual - to - real registration : real - time or pre - recorded video images i r from a bronchoscope at an unknown location are registered to a set of endoluminal ct renderings i v and depth maps z v. 2. virtual - to - virtual registration : an endoluminal rendering i r with unknown location and with or without an associated depth map z r is registered to a set of endoluminal ct renderings i v and depth maps z v. 3. real - to - real registration : real - time video images i r from an endoscope at an unknown location is registered to a set of previously recorded video images i v with known or estimated depth maps z v. 4. real - to - virtual registration : an endoluminal rendering i r with unknown position and with or without an associated depth map z r is registered to a set of previously recorded video images i v with known or estimated depth maps z v. the application has far - reaching applications, particularly in the field of assisted endoscopy. the registration between a ct volume and real - time bronchoscopic video allows the fusion of information between the ct realm and the bronchoscope. this allows regions of interest ( rois ) defined only in the ct volume to be superimposed on the real video frame to assist the physician in navigating to these rois. likewise, airway centerlines, branch labels and metric information such as distances to walls can be displayed on the video frame. a natural extension of this concept is to other forms of endoscopy such as colonoscopy, where similar guidance information could be displayed on the registered colonoscopic image. virtual - to - real registration can also be applied to pre - recorded endoscopic video, and opens the door to many post - processing options, such as mapping textural and color information available only in the endoscopic video onto the ct - derived surfaces to enable their visualization from viewpoints not available in the video alone. an application of the real - to - real registration scenario that can be envisioned for this approach, is for aerial navigation. satellite imagery, combined with topographic terrain information provides the known 3d environment, while real - time images from a mobile camera aboard an aircraft can be registered to this environment to give the aircraft & # 39 ; s location and orientation without gps or radar information. similarly, this method also assists in ground - based robotic navigation within a known environment. reference images and depth maps can be captured at known locations throughout the robot & # 39 ; s working environment using a stereo camera setup, and a camera mounted on the robot can be registered to this set of images and depth maps. 1. h. minami, y. ando, f. nomura, s. sakai, and k. shimokata, interbronchoscopist variability in the diagnosis of lung cancer by flexible bronchoscopy, chest 105 ( 2 ), pp. 1658 - 1662, june 1994. 2. i. bricault, g. ferretti, and p. cinquin, registration of real and ct - derived virtual bronchoscopic images to assist transbronchial biopsy, 17, pp. 703 - 714, october 1998. 3. j. helferty, image - guided endoscopy and its application to pulmonary medicine. phd thesis, the pennsylvania state university, 2002. 4. d. deguchi, k. mori, j. hasegawa, j. toriwaki, and h. natori et al., camera motion tracking of real bronchoscope using epipolar geometry analysis and ct derived bronchoscopic images, spie medical imaging 2002 : physiol. func. from multidim. images a clough and c. chen ( ed. ), v. 4683, pp. 30 - 41, 2002. 5. b. lucas and t. kanade, an iterative image registration technique with an application to stereo vision, proceedings of the international joint conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 674 - 679, 1981. 6. s. baker and i. matthews, equivalence and efficiency of image alignment algorithms, proceedings of the ieee conference on computer vision and pattern recognition 1, pp. 1090 - 1097, 2001. 7. h. - y. shum and r. szeliski, panoramic image misaiming, technical report msr - tr - 97 - 23, microsoft research. 8. h. - y. shum and r. szeliski, construction of panoramic image mosaics with global and local alignment, international journal of computer vision 16 ( 1 ), pp. 63 - 84, 2000. 9. t. okatani and k. deguchi, shape reconstruction from an endoscope image by shape from shading technique for a point light source at the projection center, computer vision and image understanding 66, pp. 119 - 131, may 1997. 10. a. p. kiraly, e. a. hoffman, g. mclennan, w. e. higgins, and j. m. reinhardt, 3d human airway segmentation for virtual bronchoscopy, spie medical imaging 2002 : physiology and funct. from multidim. images, a. v. clough and c. t. chen, eds. 4683, pp. 16 - 29, 2002. 11. r. swift, a. kiraly, a. sherbondy, a. l. austin, e. a. hoffman, g. mclennan, and w. e. higgins, automatic axes - generation for virtual bronchoscopic assessment of major airway obstructions, computerized medical imaging and graphics 26, pp. 103 - 118, march - april 2002.","a novel framework for fast and continuous registration between two imaging modalities is disclosed . the approach makes it possible to completely determine the rigid transformation between multiple sources at real - time or near real - time frame - rates in order to localize the cameras and register the two sources . a disclosed example includes computing or capturing a set of reference images within a known environment , complete with corresponding depth maps and image gradients . the collection of these images and depth maps constitutes the reference source . the second source is a real - time or near - real time source which may include a live video feed . given one frame from this video feed , and starting from an initial guess of viewpoint , the real - time video frame is warped to the nearest viewing site of the reference source . an image difference is computed between the warped video frame and the reference image . the viewpoint is updated via a gauss - newton parameter update and certain of the steps are repeated for each frame until the viewpoint converges or the next video frame becomes available . the final viewpoint gives an estimate of the relative rotation and translation between the camera at that particular video frame and the reference source . the invention has far - reaching applications , particularly in the field of assisted endoscopy , including bronchoscopy and colonoscopy . other applications include aerial and ground - based navigation ."
"fig1 is a simplified elevational view of a printing apparatus ; in this case a production - speed xerographic printer. the print engine 100 is of a type generally familiar in the art : a photoreceptor 102 rotates past imaging stations 104, one imaging station for each cmyk primary color, and each including ( not shown ) a charge device, laser, and development unit. each imaging station, controlled by digital data supplied thereto, places toner according to a color separation of a desired image on the photoreceptor 102, and the total color image is then transferred to a print sheet at transfer station 106. the print sheet then moves in a process direction p through a fusing station 108, and continues, at a constant velocity, past what can be called a photosensor 200. photosensor 200, which may include an associated light source, is positioned to read at least a strip of each sheet substantially immediately following fusing, fusing being considered in this embodiment the end of the printing process. fig2 is a plan view of a single sheet s as would emerge from the fuser 108 and move past the photosensor 200 as in fig1. as shown in the figure, the sheet s is approaching the photosensor 200 along process direction p. the photosensor 200, in this embodiment, is of a width ( perpendicular to p ) of about 1 cm - 3 cm, and is disposed to read a strip of comparable width on sheets s moving therepast. the overall function of the disclosed system is that, when it is desired to perform a calibration, or other test routine involving one or more test patches, on a print engine 100, the print engine is simply caused to print, on one or more sheets, a machine - readable trigger code, plus one or more test patches. following printing, the sheet moves at a substantially constant velocity past the photosensor 200. when the photosensor 200 reads and recognizes the trigger code, an associated control system, generally indicated as 300, is programmed to expect inputs from one or more test patches. the reflected light from the test patches is received by the photosensor 200 for purposes of calibration or other control. in one embodiment, the velocity of a sheet does not appreciably change between receiving an image, such as at transfer station 106 or fuser 108, and the reading by photosensor 200. as shown in fig2, a sheet s that is printed for purposes of calibration bears an image created by the print engine 100, the image including a portion of machine - readable trigger code indicated as c, placed on sheet s to be viewable by photosensor 200 as the sheet s moves therepast. immediately adjacent the machine readable code c is what is here a white space ( with no marking material ), but what can be broadly considered a control or white balance area for establishing a control reflection from the light source associated with the photosensor 200. following the control area, as sheet s moves past photosensor 200, a series of test patches t is then positioned sequentially past the photosensor 200 for recording according to a predetermined image - quality procedure. with a high - speed print engine 100, or a test routine involving a large number of necessary test patches, the test patches associated with a test routine initiated by a trigger code c may have to be spread among a plurality of sheets s. fig3 is a plan view of two sheets, s 1 and s 2, as would emerge from the fuser 108 and move past the photosensor 200 as in fig1. the first sheet to emerge from the print engine 100, indicated as s 1, includes the machine - readable code and a predetermined length of control area ; the second sheet s 2 includes the test patches t. in various embodiments, the length along the process direction p of the control area of each test patch will be determined by the overall process speed of sheets emerging from the print engine 100, as well as the responsivity of the control systems associated with photosensor 200 ( each of which affects a dwell time each patch must remain under the photosensor 200 ). a control system such as 300 is programmed to fit test patches on whatever size sheets happen to be emerging from the machine at a given time : whereas the sheet s in fig2 is on a relatively large, short - edge - fed stock, the sheets s 1, s 2 are on smaller, long - edge - fed stock. since the smaller sheets cannot fit all the necessary test patches on each sheet, multiple sheets are printed. control system 300 configures test patches on one or multiple sheets depending, for instance, on the size of the stock on which the last previous set of images was printed ( such as by taking information relating to a recent print job ). in this way, the printer would not have to momentarily switch, such as in the middle of a long print run, to a different input tray just to output one or two sheets for the test routine. another parameter control system 300 takes into account is the number of individual test patches required for a particular test triggered by the immediate machine - readable code c. the machine - readable code c must be of a configuration that is recognizable by photosensor 200 at process speeds : familiar bar - code technology can be used, but less sophisticated machine - recognizable images can be used as well. a control system can be provided that associates different machine - readable codes with performing different types of test routines, causing the photosensor 200 to expect different types of test patches depending on the specific machine - readable trigger code. in one embodiment, the printing of the test sheet such as s, having the machine - readable trigger code thereon, is the primary channel for initiating image - quality test routines. in other words, in a practical application, an overall control system governing the engine 100 initiates each of various possible test routines by directly influencing the job queue or other source of image data controlling the engine 100, causing the engine to output one or more images including the desired trigger machine - readable code and related test patches. the particular test routine is initiated only when the photosensor 200 detects the trigger code, and generally not through any other channel to the control system 300. when the photosensor 200 is used as the primary channel for initiating test routines, test routines can be scheduled through the same channels through which print jobs are scheduled, such as shown in fig1 as computer 400. ( in a practical application, computer 400 can be one of any number of stand - alone computers that are capable of sending print jobs to engine 100. ) in one strategy, a computer acting as a source of print jobs can schedule various desired tests as print jobs, scheduling the test routines between print jobs as needed, e. g., at the beginning of a shift, or following a set of jobs adding up to a total number of prints within a predetermined range. in another strategy, for instance, a test routine is scheduled following every 10, 000 prints : the counting of prints can be carried out via the print - queue software, and, in response to hitting the 10, 000 count, an interrupt job including the test sheets is scheduled as an interrupt to whatever job is being printed at the time ; but even in this case, the test routines are scheduled through the print - queue software. ( interrupt jobs are a familiar concept and utility in many types of job scheduling software. ) the feedback loop controlling the engine 100 based on test patch data collected from photosensor 200 thus operates largely independently of software sending image data to the engine 100. fig4 is a simplified plan view of the light - sensitive portions of a photosensor 200. in one embodiment, the photosensor is capable of distinguishing images suitable for recognizing machine - readable code such as a bar code, and also of accurately measuring reflected colors from the test patches, in effect acting as a spectrophotometer. as shown in the figure, one embodiment of such a photosensor includes three linear arrays 202 r, 202 g, and 202 b of photosites, each linear array including one rgb primary - color filter. u. s. pat. no. 5, 148, 268 ( and patents referenced thereby ) gives a description of a photosensitive chip suitable for such a purpose. alternatively, a photosensor arrangement such as shown and described in fig1 and 2 of u. s. pat. no. 6, 639, 669 can be used. although the area viewed by the photosensor 200 in the figures is relatively narrow compared to the width of sheets being printed upon, it may be desirable in some circumstances to provide a photosensor that extends the full width of the sheet path. although engine 100 is shown as a color xerographic printing machine, the above - described embodiment can be readily adapted for any kind of printing technology, such as monochrome xerography, or ink - jet or offset printing. the described system can be embodied in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. the claims, as originally presented and as they may be amended, encompass variations, alternatives, modifications, improvements, equivalents, and substantial equivalents of the embodiments and teachings disclosed herein, including those that are presently unforeseen or unappreciated, and that, for example, may arise from applicants / patentees and others.","a method of operating a digital printer comprises printing a machine - readable code and at least one test patch on at least one sheet . the photosensor detects the machine readable code on the moving sheet , and , in response to the detecting , initiates the photosensor reading the test patch on the moving sheet . the test patches can be distributed over many sheets , depending on the nature of the desired test routine and the type of sheet that has recently been output by the printer ."
"referring now to fig4, the industrial control system 1 includes a data port 28 configured to facilitate bi - directional access to the removable storage device 30, preferably including non - volatile memory. that is, as previously described, the industrial controller 2 is configured to utilize the removable storage device 30 as a medium on which to store backups of the program that the industrial control system 1 executes and hardware information, such as module type and module manufacturer information. in this regard, it is contemplated that the industrial controller 2 may be compatible with programs such as contrologix or controlflash, commercial available from rockwell automation. beyond storing operational programs and hardware data, the removable storage device 30 may also store individual programmable data for each module in the industrial control system 1. therefore, the industrial controller 2 can access the programmable data stored on the removable storage device 30 and use that information to automatically reconfigure devices 12 within the industrial control system 1. alternatively, it is contemplated that the desired programmable data may be stored remotely from the industrial controller 2, such as on a file server 27 that is accessible by the industrial controller 2 over an intranet or the internet 28. as will be described, this process may be utilized to facilitate cloning of a given industrial control system 2 or to automatically reconfigure a replacement module that has been inserted into the industrial control system 1 to properly operate as an replacement for the prior device 12. in particular, as will be described, the industrial controller 2 is configured to automatically identify and maintain the components of the industrial control system 1 based on all three fundamental characteristics for each component in the industrial control system 1. that is, unlike prior art system such as those described with respect to fig1 - 3, individual programmable data 20 including configuration data 18 and firmware 19 can be backed up onto the removable storage device 30. by enabling the programmable data 20 to be included on the removable storage device 30, as will be described, industrial controllers can be configured to automatically access the programmable data 20 and use this information to automatically reconfigure replacement modules or build a clone of a given industrial control system. in this regard, the process of reconfiguring a replacement device or building a clone of a given industrial control system is not only further facilitated but may even be automated so that human interaction with the industrial control system by a programmer utilizing specialized software may be reduced or, in some cases, even a eliminated. referring now to fig5, the industrial controller 2 is in communication with each device 12 a, 12 b, 12 c, 12 d in the industrial control system 1. in this regard, the industrial controller 2 requests identity information from each individual device 12 a, 12 b, 12 c, 12 d in the industrial control system 1. when received by the industrial controller 2, the identity information is processed by a processor 37 to compile a device list 38 that is stored in a system memory 40 of the industrial controller 12. the device list 38 is a list that includes device identity information 39 and associated in programmable data 41 communicated by each device 12 a, 12 b, 12 c, 12 d. for example, when a given device 12 a in the industrial control system 1 receives a request from the industrial controller 2 for identity information, the device 12 a responds by communicating that it is a device having identity a and includes programmable data such as a firmware version of version 3. upon receipt, the processor 37 integrates the information 39, 41 communicated by the device 12 a into the device list 38. therefore, each entry in the device list 38 includes the module identity 39, such as module type and manufacturer information, and corresponding programmable data 41, for example, a firmware version. when the removable storage medium 30 is engaged with the industrial controller 2, the information in the device list 38 is compared against a list 42 of desired information stored on the removable storage medium 30. in this regard, for example, the industrial controller 2 can immediately identify that the device 12 c having identity a and firmware version 2 is incorrect because the list 42 of desired characteristics stored on the removable storage medium 30 indicates that a device having identity a should have firmware version 3. therefore, as will be described with respect to fig5, the industrial controller 2 can transmit the desired firmware version 3 from the removable storage device 30 to device 12 c to replace incorrect firmware version 2 residing thereon. referring now to fig6, a process for supervising and maintaining programmable data across a plurality of devices in an industrial control system 43 begins when the industrial controller is powered 44. the industrial controller then determines whether it is currently configured to update its software automatically 46. in this regard, the software of the industrial controller may include an operating program, a control program, and / or configuration data. if so 48, the industrial controller automatically loads the most recent software currently available 50 and then continues its power - on sequence by loading a communications program 52. on the other hand, if the industrial controller is not configured to automatically update its software 54, the update sequence 50 is bypassed and the industrial controller continues by loading the communication program 52. once capable of communication with other components within the industrial control system by loading the communications program 52, the industrial controller requests identity information from each device in the industrial control system 56. when this information is received for a given device, the industrial controller determines whether that device is approved for updates 58. this may be done by accessing a list of device identities currently approved for updates or, update approval information may be simply embedded in or associated with the identity information received from the device 56. if the device is not approved for updates 60, the industrial controller discontinues the update process for that devices and continues by determining whether other devices are approved for updates 58. when a device is identified that is approved for updates 62, the industrial controller then determines whether that devices is set for exact matching of programmable data 64. if the device is not set for exact matching of programmable data 66, the industrial controller again discontinues the update process for that devices and continues by determining whether other devices are approved for updates 58 and set for exact matching 64. once a device that is set for exact matching of programmable data is identified 68, the industrial controller determines whether the current device programmable data associated with the identity information transmitted by the device matches a desired programmable data associated with the particular devices identity 70. it is contemplated that this information may be stored on the removable storage device and randomly accessed by the industrial controller or may be preloaded from the removable storage device as part of the software update 50. alternatively, it is contemplated that the desired programmable data may be stored remotely from the industrial controller, such as on a file server that is accessible by the industrial controller over an intranet or the internet. if the current programmable data matches the stored programmable data 72, no further action with respect to that device is required and the industrial controller simply continues with its iterative and periodic requests for identity information from each device 56. on the other hand, if the current programmable data does not match the stored programmable data for that particular device, the industrial controller automatically accesses the desired programmable data and sends that programmable data to the particular device 76. the programmable data may include configuration data as well as firmware or a combination thereof. in either case, the device responds by replacing previous programmable data with the current programmable data sent by the industrial controller 76. it is contemplated that a reconfiguration package or firmware kit may be pushed from the industrial controller to the device requiring updating. this package may including a self - executing program that, upon receipt at the device, is automatically executed to update the programmable data 76. alternatively, an update, for example a firmware update, may be sent to the device and, in response, the device may execute a self - update procedure to install the firmware update, for example, by copying an image of the firmware update into memory. it is contemplated that this firmware supervisor process 78 for checking and maintaining programmable data across the devices of the industrial control system 78 may be iteratively and periodically performed. that is, the industrial controller may be configured to repeatedly work through the loops within the firmware supervisor process 78 to continuously check whether the current programmable data of each device matches the desired programmable data. accordingly, it is possible to immediately and automatically update the programmable data of a replacement device engaged with the industrial control system without the need for a programmer to utilize a separate computer system to manually perform such a process. in this regard, headless updates can be performed. furthermore, it is contemplated, that this updating and maintenance process may be performed during operation of the industrial control system, whereby replacement devices may be automatically updated without the industrial control system being required to be shut down. accordingly, the devices may be hot swappable. alternatively, rather than performing the device checking and update process 78 iteratively and periodically, it may be performed upon occurrence of a specific event. for example, the process 78 may be initiated in response to a system power on event, an industrial controller power on event, a device replacement event, a device power on event, a removable memory engagement event, a communications loss event, a memory failure event, expiration of a time limit, or user initiation such as by a pushbutton or the like. therefore, a system and method for collecting and storing programmable data for each device in an industrial control system is created. this stored programmable data can then be utilized to automatically match programmable data of a given device in the industrial control system based on the identity of that device. accordingly, an industrial control system may be effectively and efficiently cloned or replacement devices engaged with the industrial control system can be automatically updated without requiring a user or programmer to manually reconfigure the programmable data. the present invention has been described in terms of the preferred embodiments, and it should be appreciated that many equivalents, alternatives, variations, and modifications, aside from those expressly stated, are possible and within the scope of the invention. therefore, the invention should not be limited to a particular described embodiment.","an industrial control system includes a central controller having a memory containing programmable data including operating programs for operating the controller , control program for controlling an industrial process , and configuration data configuring values used by the operating program and control program . the central controller is designed to control multiple devices also having memory holding programmable data including operating programs and configuration data . a program is executable by the central controller that causes the central controller to identify memories distributed through the industrial control system having programmable data and collect the programmable data from the memories . accordingly , the collected programmable data may be used to substantially recreate operation of the industrial control system in a second industrial control system having another central controller substantially identical to the industrial controller and multiple devices connected to the central controller ."

e & # 34 ; ring e1 fits in a circumferential groove in the shaft 15 to prevent removal of the take - up reel pawl means from the tape player. fig3 shows a supply reel pawl or spindle means that includes a rewind reel gear 22 arranged at the center of the other opening 8 in the chassis 2. the rewind reel gear 22 comprises a metal plate 22a and a gear - tooth ring member 22b. the gear - tooth ring member 22b is formed at the periphery of the metal plate 22a by injection molding a synthetic resin and has at its outer periphery gear teeth 22a. the supply reel pawl means includes a supply reel pawl hub or spindle 23 having a hollow interior 23a and a bearing portion 23b. the supply reel pawl hub 23 is formed integrally in a central opening 24 of the metal plate 22a by injection molding a synthetic resin in place on the metal plate 22a. the supply reel pawl hub 23 engages the supply reel hub 1b of the tape cassette 1 for driving the tape cassette supply reel when the supply reel pawl 23 rotates. a drive motor m is attached to the chassis plate 17 under the rewind reel gear 22, as shown in fig3. the motor m is a flat, substantially planar brushless motor, the main body of which comprises a rotor portion and a stator portion, both of which are very thin. the drive motor m and its mounting in accordance with the present invention are shown in detail in fig3 a and 4b. a circular platform portion 17a of the chassis plate 17 nests inside the rewind reel gear 22. the chassis plate 17 has a central opening 25. a through hole 26 is formed axially of a cylindrical bearing sleeve 27 secured to the chassis plate 17 in the opening 25. an upper end portion or extension 27a of the bearing sleeve 27 is disposed within the hollow interior 23a of the supply reel pawl hub 23. a cylindrical, oil - impregnated sintered bearing 28 fits within the upper end of the bearing sleeve 27. a cylindrical ball bearing 29 is press - fitted into the through hole 26 at the lower end portion or extension 27b of the bearing sleeve 27 which extends externally of the supply reel pawl hub 23. threads are formed externally on the upper end portion 27a of the bearing sleeve 27. a coil spring 30 is disposed between a cylindrical thrust member 31 and the bearing sleeve 27. internal threads are formed in the cylindrical thrust member 31 and the thrust member 31 is screwed onto the upper end portion 27a of the sleeve against the biasing force of the coil spring 30. the spring 30 prevents the thrust member 31 from inadvertantly moving during use of the tape player. a central hole 32 is formed in the top of the thrust member 31 and a hole 33, aligned with the hole 32, is formed in the supply reel pawl 23. the rotor 34 of the motor m is made of a magnetic material such as bmc ( bulkmold compound ). the rotor 34 includes a flat portion 34a which nests inside the platform portion 17a of the chassis plate 17, and a downwardly projecting central portion 34b. the central portion 34b includes a shoulder 34c. the lower end portion 27b of the bearing sleeve 27 fits within a recess 35 formed by the central portion 34b. a motor pulley mp carrying a drive belt 36 is formed integrally in the lower end of the portion 34b of the rotor 34. a hole 37 is formed centrally in the central portion 34b of the rotor 34. a motor shaft 38 has its lower portion 38a press - fitted into the hole 37. the shaft 38 extends vertically from the rotor 34 and the upper portion 38b of the shaft goes through the ball bearing 29, the through hole 26 of the bearing sleeve 27, the sintered bearing 28, and the holes 32 and 33. & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; rings e2 and e3 fit into respective circumferential grooves in the motor shaft 38. the lower & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; ring e2 is in contact with an upper face 31a of the thrust member 31 and as the thrust member 31 is turned it forces the rotor 34 and the rotating shaft 38 upwardly. the upper & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; ring e3 prevents removal of the supply reel pawl means. the supply reel pawl hub 23 and the rewind reel gear 22 rotate freely on the motor shaft 38. the inner surface of the supply reel pawl hub 23 at the bearing portion 23b thereof slides on an outer circumferential surface of the bearing sleeve 27. thus, in the present invention, the supply reel pawl means rotates independently of the rotor 34 of the motor m. a ring - like flat rotor magnet 41, alternately magnetized to north and south poles along its circumference, is fixed to the lower surface of the flat portion 34a of the rotor 34. a stator coil assembly 42 having an annular flat configuration is fixed to the chassis plate 17 by screws ( not shown ) or other suitable fastening means to face the rotor magnet 41. a central opening 42a in the stator coil assembly 42 loosely receives the central portion 34b of the rotor 34. as shown in fig4 b, the stator coil assembly 42 includes six coil units 43a to 43f, each of which comprises a pair of coils, mounted on a lead mounting portion 44a of a printed circuit board 44. the circuit board 44 includes a drive circuit 44b adjacent to the lead mounting portion 44a. the six coil pairs 43a to 43f are located in an annular pattern around the ring - shaped lead mounting portion 44a so that each pair of coils sandwiches the lead mounting portion 44a therebetween. the lead mounting portion 44a and the coil units 43a to 43f are made into an integral unit using synthetic resin. a circular hysteresis plate 45 is attached to the rotor 34 opposite the lower surface of the stator coil assembly 42. the hysteresis plate 45 is centered by the central portion 34b of the rotor 34 in a central hole 46 of the plate 45. the hysteresis plate 45 is attracted upward by the magnetic attraction of the magnet 41. the hysteresis plate 45 is supported by the shoulder 34c on the central portion 34b. in accordance with the present invention, the bearing sleeve 27 has the oilless bearing 28 and the ball bearing 29 disposed therein at a significant distance & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; from each other, as shown in fig3. thus, power consumption and distortion from wow and flutter are minimized even though a flat brushless motor is used because the distance between the two bearings 28, 29 can be made long enough to overcome those problems. in accordance with the present invention, the motor m is arranged coaxially with a pawl means of the recorder which is rotatable independently of the motor. a separate drive means, described in detail below, is used to drive the supply and take - up pawl hubs. the thickness of the motor m in the axial direction of the shaft 38 is therefore greatly reduced, and the size of the tape player can be made very compact. fig5 shows the drive system for the tape player. the belt 36 travels around the motor pulley mp on the rotor 34 of the motor m and around the periphery of a capstan flywheel 3f. the motor m drives the belt 36 in the direction indicated by the arrow a. the belt 36 also drives a master gear - pulley 47 that is movable between three positions, as described below, for providing play, fast - forward and rewind modes of operation, respectively. the master gear - pulley 47 includes an idler pulley 47p which remains in contact with the belt 36 and a first master drive gear 47a and a second master drive gear 47b. the motor m drives the capstan 3 and the master gear - pulley 47 in the directions indicated by the arrows in fig5. the first master drive gear 47a meshes with the gear teeth 12a on the reel gear 12 when the player is operated in the play mode. the twin fast - forward drive gears 21 are rotatably mounted on the chassis plate 17 near the idler pulley 47p and the fast - forward reel gear 10 ( see fig2 ). the twin fast - forward drive gears 21 comprise a first ff drive gear 21a above the chassis 2 and a second ff drive gear 21b below the chassis plate 17. the first ff drive gear 21a meshes with the gear teeth 10a of the fast - forward reel gear 10, and the second ff drive gear 21b meshes with the second master drive gear 47b of the master gear - pulley 47 when the player operated is in the fast - forward mode. twin rewind drive gears 48 are rotatably mounted on the chassis plate 17 near the master gear - pulley 47 and at the side of the rewind reel gear 22. a first rewind drive gear 48a above the chassis plate 17 meshes with the gear teeth 22a on the rewind reel gear 22. a second rewind drive gear 48b below the chassis plates 17 meshes with the second master drive gear 47b of the master gear - pulley 47 when the player operated is in the rewind mode. the operation of the drive system is shown in fig6 a - 6c. fig6 a depicts the play mode of the player. when a play button ( not shown ) is depressed, the master gear - pulley 47 moves in the direction indicated by the arrow x p, so the first master drive gear 47a meshes with the gear teeth 12a on the play reel gear 12. the play reel gear 12 rotates counter - clockwise, and, through the friction plate 13, causes the take - up reel pawl hub 9 to rotate. ( see fig2. ) the play button also actuates a mechanism ( not shown ) that moves the pinch roller 4 toward the rotating capstan 3 to advance the tape past the head 6. fig6 b depicts the fast - forward mode of operation of the player. when a fast - forward button ( not shown ) is depressed, the master gear - pulley 47 swings in the direction indicated by the arrow x f, so the second master drive gear 47b meshes with the second ff drive gear 21b of the twin fast - forward drive gears 21. the twin fast - forward drive gears 21 thus rotate counterclockwise to propel the fast - forward reel gear 10 counterclockwise and advance the tape at a rapid rate. the pinch roller 4 is not pressed against the capstan 3 in the fast - forward mode. fig6 c depicts the rewind mode of operation of the player. when a rewind button ( not shown ) is depressed, the master gear - pulley 47 swings in the direction indicated by the arrow x r, so that the second master drive gear 47b meshes with the second rewind drive gear 48b of the twin rewind drive gears 48. the twin rewind drive gears 48 rotate counterclockwise and rotate the rewind reel gear 22 clockwise to rewind the tape from the take - up reel to the supply reel. thus, with the present invention a cassette tape player can be made with dimensions that only slightly exceed the dimensions of the cassette being played, as shown in fig1 - 3, while providing high fidelity reproduction and power consumption low enough to make battery operation possible. and, as fig2 - 4 show, the various parts of the player can be & # 34 ; nested & # 34 ; to reduce even further the thickness of the player. the high fidelity and low power consumption of the tape reproducing apparatus of the present invention in spite of its small size is the result of using the vertical space available in one of the pawl hubs to increase the length between the motor shaft bearings, while permitting the pawl hub to rotate relative to the motor rotor. the pawl hub is then driven independently of the rotation of the motor shaft. fig7 shows a modification of the above - described embodiment of the present invention. the modified embodiment is similar to the supply reel pawl means shown in fig3 except that the coil spring 30, the thrust member 31, and the & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; ring e2 are omitted. a chassis plate 17 & # 39 ; is made of magnetic material. thus, the rotor 34 and the shaft 38 are urged upwardly by the magnetic attraction between the chassis plate 17 & # 39 ; and the rotor magnet 41. the rotor 34 presses against the ball bearing 29, the outer race 29a of which is press - fitted in a bearing sleeve 27 & # 39 ;, so that a pre - load is applied to the ball bearing 29. in this embodiment the inner race 29b of the ball bearing 29 loosely fits on the rotating shaft 38. for this reason, when the shaft 38 is attracted upwardly by the magentic force as described above, an annular rib 34d on the rotor 34 urges the inner race 29b upwardly. however, upward movement of the inner race 29b is restricted by the balls between the races 29a and 29b, and thus the ball bearing 29 determines positions of the bearing sleeve 27 & # 39 ; and the shaft 38. in this embodiment an & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; ring e & # 39 ; prevents removal of the shaft 38 from the bearing sleeve 27 & # 39 ;. according to the modification shown in fig7 the thrust member 31 in the previous embodiment may be omitted, and the thickness of the motor along the axial direction of the shaft 38 can be reduced even further. although specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those embodiments, and that various changes and modifications other than those specifically pointed out can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the following claims.","a compact cassette tape player has a motor drive system which enables a high - fidelity tape player to be made only slightly larger than the cassette being played . the tape player includes a motor which has a flat stator mounted to the player chassis , a motor shaft and a flat motor which is mounted to the motor shaft for rotation relative to the stator . the recorder includes reel pawl hubs or spindles for engaging the tape reels in the cassette . the motor shaft extends into one of the pawl hubs and is mounted in bearings at the ends of the shaft . one of the bearings is located inside the pawl hub so that the bearing mountings for the motor shaft can be spaced as far apart as possible , thus reducing the amount of wow and flutter even though the player is extremely compact . the pawl hub mounting the motor shaft is driven independently of the motor by a drive gear which engages the periphery of a gear wheel secured to the pawl hub . the drive gear is driven by a drive belt which extends from the motor rotor to the player capstan ."
"reference now will be made to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. in fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in this invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. for instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. other objects, features and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in or are obvious from the following detailed description. it is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention, which broader aspects are embodied in the exemplary constructions. poly - aryl ethers containing perfluorocyclobutyl ( pfcb ) linkages are viable candidates for optical and opto - electronic applications due in part to their wide range of complementary properties. the properties of such compounds include excellent thermal and thermo - oxidative stability, high tg, low moisture absorption, low dielectric constant, variable refractive index, and desirable melt and solution processability. furthermore, poly - aryl ethers containing pfcb linkages are among the few known optical polymers to possess low attenuation losses in the technologically important 1, 550 and 1300 nm region. turning now to the figures, fig1 shows a simplified schematic of prior art processes for soft lithography microfabrication 20 which begins with a silicon master 21. a pdms ( polydimethylsiloxane ) layer 22 is applied as a liquid to the silicon master 21 and allowed to harden. then, the replicated pdms layer is removed from the silicon master. the pdms layer then is used to replicate a pfcb ( perfluorocyclobutane ) polymer structure 23. [ 0030 ] fig1 a shows a schematic diagram showing conventional ( prior art ) non - photolithographic processing method 25 which employs micromolding in capillaries ( mimic ) 26 and microcontact printing ( cp ) 27. the mimic process provides a polymer melt on the surface of the silicon master 26, followed by hardening into a substrate 29. on the other hand, processes employing microcontact printing use a standard replication, as shown at the right side of the fig1 a. pfcb polymers are prepared from trifluorovinyl aromatic ether monomers via a free radical mediated thermal co - polymerization mechanism as shown in fig2. a representative example of some of the groups that may be included and used as the ar group as shown in fig2 are included in fig3 a - 3 g. a variety of monomers may be used to produce the pfcb polymers, however, the monomers shown in fig3 a, 3b, and 3 c have been studied in some detail pursuant to work done in connection with this invention. bis - and tris - functionalized tve monomers polymerize to form linear or network polymers respectively with unique optical, thermal and mechanical properties. furthermore, accurate controls over the polymer properties may be achieved by co - polymerization. for example, the pfcb polymer shown in fig3 b is suitable for task specific photonic and opto - electronic applications. discussions of remaining figures are presented below in connection with the example. there are procedures that can be used to fabricate microscopic and submicroscopic device suitable patterns of pfcb polymers and copolymers. these procedures do not involve photo - lithography but instead rely upon photolithographically generated silicon masters for rapid replication of pfcb based microstructures. in addition, methods may be used which preclude the need for elastomeric negative molds for a more cost effective and reproducible prototype. synthesis of tve monomers has been performed. tve monomers were melt or solution polymerized either in - situ or ex - situ during micro - fabrication at 150 - 160 c. under inert condition. polymers shown in fig3 a, 3b, and 3 c have been used for optical applications. bis and tris functionalized tve monomers polymerize to form linear or network polymers respectively with unique optical, thermal and mechanical properties. accurate control over polymer properties can be achieved by copolymerization. microscopic and submicroscopic device suitable patterns of pfcb polymers and copolymers may be employed which do not involve photolithography but rely upon photolithographically generated silicon masters for rapid replication of pfcb based microstructures, as further shown in fig5. in addition, methods have been developed that preclude the need for elastomeric negative molds for more cost effective and reproducible prototypes, as further shown below. refractive indices were measured using an abbe refractometer, modified to permit wavelength tuning. scanning electron micrographs were obtained using a hitachi s - 4700 field emission microscope. silicon master templates ( diffraction gratings with 1 mm pitch in this case ) were generated by first coating 75 mm diameter p - type & lt ; 100 & gt ; wafers with 1, 1 mm thick shipley s1811 photoresist followed by 2. 8 second exposure in a contact aligner using 1 mm pitch chrome mask. after developing the photoresist, the grating pattern was transferred onto the silicon substrate by reactive ion etching ( rie ) with chf 3 / sf 6 gaseous mix. transmission spectra were collected on a shimadzu uv3101 spectrophotometer and reflectance data was obtained using a gretag macbeth ce741 goniospectrometer. pfcb polymers can be prepared neat or in solution at temperatures in excess of 160 c. and do not require initiators or catalysts. the polymerization proceeds via a thermally activated cyclodimerization process as shown in fig2. although free - radical mediated, the cycloaddition polymerization follows classical step growth kinetics as shown earlier. the polymers can be advanced to precisely controlled viscosity, molecular weight and dispersity by simple heating. the bifunctional tve monomers yield linear polymers with m n 80, 000 whereas trifunctional monomers can be melt advanced to branched pre - networks and processed prior to final cure. pfcb materials, in general, possess excellent thermal ( t g = 120 350 c. ), mechanical and environmental properties providing long - term stability at 350 c. the adaptability of pfcb polymers for optical applications can be further demonstrated by their low visible / nir loss characteristics and variable refractive indices achieved from random copolymers by simply controlling the co - monomer composition as shown in fig4. in fig4 the wavelength is plotted against the refractive index for compounds shown as fig3 a, 3b, 3 c and also for co - polymerized compounds 3 a / 3 b and 3 c / 3 b. micro - contact printing ( mcp ) and micro - molding in capillaries ( mimic ), as shown in the prior art ( fig1 a ) both techniques work with pfcb polymers. however, surprisingly, it has been found that the pdms negative - mold can be eliminated for pfcb polymers, greatly simplifying the process. referring now to fig5 pfcb replicas may be generated by directly molding the polymer against silicon masters as shown schematically. a negative mold free micromolding process 32 is shown with silicon master 33 subjected to solution melt casting. a pfcb polymer 34 is applied to the silicon master 33, and following evaporation or cure, a pfcb polymer is produced. since pfcb polymers provide low interfacial surface energy, the replicated structures can be easily lifted off from the master without irreversible adhesion or defects. homopolymers or copolymers can be melt or solution cast onto the silicon masters containing 0. 5 mm features. however, the lift - off process is simplified to a large extent by solution - casting due to the plasticizing effect of the solvent which can be subsequently removed by vacuum drying. the fabricated submicron pfcb gratings were examined by scanning electron microscopy as shown in fig6. the surface topography and spacing were found to be uniform over large surface areas without any noticeable defects or distortions. diffraction grating 36 is shown with ridges 37 shown in the figure with the distance between each ridge of about 1. 0 m. in some applications, the ridges may be further apart, as much as 10 - 20 m, or even as great at 30 - 49 m apart. in some applications, the ridges may be as small as 0. 5 m or less in spaced relation to each other. however, this resolution is still significantly better than most prior art processes. the cross - section ( inset ) shows artificial contortion due to ductile pull - out of the sample. the grating performance was tested by measuring the optical response in the transmission and reflection geometries. fig7 shows the uv / vis / nir transmission profile of a pfcb diffraction grating in comparison with a pfcb planar film. a peak at 500 nm is observed due to the attenuation caused by the 500 nm spacing of the grating. a second order diffraction peak at 1000 nm is also evident. the observed peaks are broader than expected because of sample curvature and / or finite beam size effects, which most likely accessed a range of incident angles. on the other hand the uv / vis reflectance measurement show well - defined peaks covering the entire spectrum for several incident angles as indicated in fig8. the negative mold - free technique highlighted in this process demonstrates feature reproduction at submicron scales. refractive indices of pfcb polymers can be precisely controlled making them suitable for optical and opto - electronic applications. these polymers can also be micro - patterned with 0. 5 mm features using soft - lithographic techniques. a novel negative mold - free technique also simplifies the fabrication process by eliminating several steps from the conventional methods and produces free standing pfcb micro - structures. [ 0041 ] fig9 shows several applications of the invention. first, a monomer may be reacted to an ologomer, and further to a polymer or copolymer. any one of these may be used in micromolding an optical device. for example, a monomer may be introduced onto a silicon master, and allowed to cure while resident on the master. or, an ologomer may be introduced onto a master, and treated in much the same way. alternately, a fully polymerized material in liquid form may be applied to a silicon master, and hardened. micromolding is followed by curing the polymer, and formation of a thermoplastic or thermoset micromolded product. it is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention, which broader aspects are embodied in the exemplary constructions. the invention is shown by example in the appended claims.","fluoropolymers consisting of alternating perfluorocyclobutane and aryl ether linkages possess suitable properties for optical waveguides and other devices using refractive properties of the polymers . perfluorocyclobutane polymers having aryl groups alternating on an ether chain have shown useful physical properties for optical waveguide applications . processes for micromolding such polymeric films by replicating a pattern or image directly from a silicon master , rather than from a polydimethyl siloxane mold ) are disclosed ."

end and back - end code run on the same san controller providing as much bandwidth as such implementation ( hardware, firmware, or embedded software ) allows. in addition, unusually, there is only one instance of code and data structures that handles particular virtual disk. therefore, all i / o traffic associated with that particular virtual disk is handled by that code instance which could become a bottleneck in heavy i / o traffic conditions. some solutions utilize shared memory architecture to improve i / o bandwidth. however, again, one single instance of the data structures has to be accessed creating opportunity for a bottleneck to occur. as motioned in the preceding paragraphs, this solution does not scale well since there is no option of scaling the processing power by adding more controllers. fig3, the present invention, illustrates the hardware architecture that enables parallel execution of the front - end and back - end code on the fe _ san and be _ san controllers respectively. there are multiple instances of the front - end code, preferably one or more per host or cluster node. likewise, one or more be san controllers at the back - end execute back - end code in parallel. fe _ san and be _ san controllers are connected via interconnecting network, preferably via rearrangeably non - blocking clos network utilizing but not limited to inexpensive as or myrinet switches. nevertheless, any network topology is allowed since the architecture is network ( transport ) neutral. however, if the underlying network provides lower latency and higher bandwidth the whole architecture will deliver better performance. this approach yields to the higher data rate and i / o performance compared to previously described legacy san system. preferably the present invention is implemented in firmware running over a multitasking pre - emptive real time operating system ( rtos ) on hardware platform comprised of one or more embedded central processing units ( cpus ), possibly application - specific integrated circuits ( asic ), or field - programmable gate arrays ( fpga ), a random access memory ( ram ), and programmable input / output ( i / o ) interfaces. it is to be appreciated that the various processes and functions described herein may be either part of the hardware, embedded microinstructions running on the hardware, or firmware ( embedded software ) executed by the rtos. however, it should be further understood that the present invention might be implemented in various other forms of hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. fig5 a and 5b are high - level block diagrams that illustrate software layers inside the system software on the host side and front - end and back - end layers specific for legacy raid and storage area network controller. certainly, there are more than just front - end and back - end layers in a san software architecture however ; this is not relevant for understanding of the concepts used in this invention. scsi standard defines the device model and scsi command set for all scsi devices ( please see fig7 a ). the scsi command set is designed to provide efficient peer - to - peer operation of scsi devices ( disks, tapes, printers, etc. ) by an operating system. the scsi command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent control over one or more scsi devices. however, proper coordination of activities between the multiple operating systems is critical to avoid data corruption. commands that assist with coordination between multiple operating systems are described in the scsi standard. fig6, is a high - level block diagram that illustrates how front - end and back - end code are executed in parallel and independently on fe _ san and be _ san controllers. even though, scsi standard provides methods for a number of hosts ( operating systems ) concurrently accessing and asserting control over scsi devices, in a complex system such as the one shown on the fig6 that may not be sufficient. if there was no mechanism to internally enforce atomic execution for read, write, and some other commands, the data integrity could be jeopardized. consequently, such locking mechanism that provides atomicity has to be built in to the system. the issue is that some kind of the actions ( requests or commands ) that have to be atomic must not be executed until it is safe to do so. atomic execution for some commands in the system from fig6 is essential part of the invention since it protects the data integrity. front - end code, generally, performs command processing and virtual block address ( vba ) translation to logical block address ( lba ) and sends them to the appropriate be _ san controllers. the back - end code, then, checks whether the command could be executed immediately or not. the command may have to be queued for later execution, or yet busy signal could be returned to the front - end code. since, the front - end and back - end codes execute asynchronously before a command that requires atomic execution, such as writing to device media, could be started all the requirements for successful command completion have to be met. for example, to ensure correct execution of a write command, lbas that data have to written to have to be locked and off limit to other write or read commands. that means that write command has to be executed atomically. the front - end code will examine the command ; determine that a write command had been received. then it will send a lock request to the appropriate be _ san controllers to acquire distributed lock. back - end code will respond acknowledging successful locking of the requested lbas. at this point, it is safe to write to the locked lbas, lbas usually spread across multiple disk drives. upon the successful completion of the write command, the lock is removed by the front - end code. there are some other commands that might require atomic execution ; however the same locking mechanism could be used for those commands. previously described method would not permit concurrent writes to occur to the same lbas which would limit the write performance to a single file. indeed, it is not possible to actually write data to a disk media simultaneously from two different and independent sources without having a risk of actually corrupting the data. however, if sufficient buffer space is available at be - san controllers the data that have to be written from number of different hosts ( initiators ) could be concurrently spooled into pre - allocated independent memory buffers without risking data corruption. to achieve this kind of parallelism on a write request fe _ san controller will request a lock for all lbas that have to be written to. if currently there are no other writers, the lock will be granted. however, if there is another writer holding a lock, every be _ san controller has to be written to will check if there is sufficient buffer space to satisfy the request. if the request could be satisfied a tagged - lock will be issued and the data transfer from the host to the allocated buffer would be initiated. the actual writes to the disks would be done in the order that tagged - locks are granted. if the front - end code for some reason was unable to acquire a lock on all the lbas it needs it will release all already locked lbas and start the process all over again. in case that default number of attempts is exceeded upper management software layers will resolve the issue by verifying the reason for the unsuccessful locking. an additional advantage is that the locks are associated with luns using specific id ( identifiers ). therefore, back - end code would not have to search through long lock tables to discover whether a command ( request ) could be executed or not. another advantage is that only lbas that are locked out might be inaccessible during that time. all other lbas are accessible allowing greater level for parallelism. the actual implementation may vary due to use of some specific hardware or of the shelf software. however, the principal architecture would not change. it would be relatively straight forward to use of the shelf inexpensive but not limited to x86 hardware platform with embedded rt os or embedded linux os on it for the be _ san controllers since great deal of functionality is already available. for the fe _ san controllers the same platform could be used as for the be _ san controllers. however, if as or myrinet network is the interconnect of choice between fe _ san and be _ san controllers it would be natural to use of the shelf or modified pcie single board computer or myrinet interface cards to execute front - end code on them. for entry - level systems, where the cost is more important than performance, the front - end code could be embedded in the device driver. in an embodiment, individual storage units such as hard disk drives 902, 904, 906, 908, 910 are coupled to back - end storage controller ( be _ san ) 912. further, individual storage units such as hard disk drives 922, 924, 926, 928, 930 are coupled to at least a second back - end storage controller ( be _ san ) 932. both be _ sans 912, 932 are coupled to be accessed through network 940 from at least one or more fe _ san controller 942, 944. further, each fe _ san is coupled to at least one host computer 950, 952. fig9 illustrates virtual disks that span multiple disk drives, such as virtual disks 954, 956, 958. in an embodiment, virtual disk 954 uses hard disks 902, 904, 906, virtual disk 956 uses hard disks 908, 910, 922 spanning two be _ sans, and virtual disk 958 uses hard disks 924, 926, and 928. hard disk 930 is initially a hot spare storage device. virtual disk 954 is configured as a raid ( redundant array of independent disk drives ) storage system. in normal operation, storage references to virtual disk 954 are processed in part by be _ san 912 executing raid code 970 on a processor, such as a cpu of be _ san 912. raid code 970 includes code for writing physical drives, such as drives 902, 904, 906, recognizing failed disk drives, for reconstructing data read from functioning drives and transmitting that data through network 940 to an accessing fe _ san, all as per specifications for one or more of raid modes 1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as known in the art of raid storage systems. in a particular embodiment, virtual disk 954 is configured to operate as a raid - 5 mode virtual disk, with block - level striping and distributed parity, such that redundancy is minimized but data is recoverable even if one drive used by virtual disk 954 has failed. in an alternative embodiment, virtual disk 954 is configured to operate as a raid - 6 mode virtual disk system. in an embodiment, virtual disk 958, operating with drives 924 926, 928, on the second be _ san 932, is also configurable as a raid, in an embodiment a raid - 5 mode virtual disk, and in an alternative embodiment a raid - 6 mode virtual disk. some existing raid controllers, including some operable in raid - 5 or raid - 6 modes, have the ability to reconstruct data onto a replacement hard disk from remaining disks used by a raid dataset or virtual disk ; in these systems, once a failed disk has been replaced with a spare disk, data is reconstructed onto the spare disk. once data is reconstructed onto the spare disk - which becomes a formerly - spare disk, redundancy is restored and, should a second disk used by the raid virtual disk fail in turn, data can once again be reconstructed from still - functioning disks ( which may include the formerly - spare disk ) and provided to host systems. a hot spare is a disk that is attached to a raid controller, and unused by existing configured virtual disks. when a disk containing part of data of a raid virtual disk fails, the hot spare may be substituted for the failed disk without requiring that a technician physically replace the failed disk. in some systems this replacement may require operator intervention, and in other systems a hot - spare may be substituted for a failed disk automatically. once a hot - spare is substituted into a raid dataset or virtual disk, data may be reconstructed onto the hot - spare which becomes a formerly - spare disk and redundancy may be restored. typically, however, the hot - spare must be attached to the same raid controller as the failed drive. in an embodiment of the invention, a hot - spare 930 is provided on be _ san 832. should a physical disk drive associated with a raid virtual disk, such as disk 926 of raid virtual disk 958, that is attached to the same be _ san 932, the hot - spare may be substituted for disk 926 of raid virtual disk 932. consider a situation where a physical disk drive, such as drive 904, attached to a different be _ san, such as be _ san 912, is the physical hard disk that fails. in traditional raid systems, a hot - spare attached to a different raid controller than a failed drive is not accessible to replace that failed drive, and redundancy can not be restored until a technician replaces the failed drive. in the embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in fig9 and 10, if no hot - spare is located on the same be _ san 912 as the failed drive, such as drive 904, forwarding code within raid code 970 intercepts communications typical of those addressed to a hot spare, including those required for reconstruction of data on the hot - spare as required to restore redundancy, and relays those communications through network 940, and through a be _ san, such as be _ san 932, that has a hot - spare, and to that hot - spare, such as hot spare 930. while such operation may in some embodiments be slower than those where all physical drives associated with a raid mode 5 or 6 virtual disk are attached to the same be _ san, this forwarding is sufficient to allow redundancy to be restored and permit reliable system operation until the system can be repaired. further, this forwarding permits operation of both non - raid and raid virtual disks, such as raid virtual disk 956, that span physical hard drives associated with more than one be _ san. in this embodiment of the invention, one hot - spare may be provided for two or more be _ sans, and that hot - spare may be used to restore redundancy and reliable operation regardless of which single physical hard disk attached to any of the two or more be _ sans has failed. further, the system may be configured to implement be _ san - spanning virtual volumes, such that one or more physical disks drive associated with a virtual volume hosted by a first be _ san, such as be _ san 912 may be coupled instead to a second be _ san, such as be _ san 932 ; the first be _ san 912 recognizes that a particular disk access to a particular logical block is to a physical sector on a drive on the second be _ san 932 and relays communications over the network 940 and through the second be _ san 932, in a manner similar to that required for use of a drive on the second be _ san as a hot - spare for a raid set hosted primarily by the first be _ san. the foregoing description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the disclosure. it should thus be noted that the matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings should be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. the following claims are intended to cover generic and specific features described herein, as well as all statements of the scope of the present method and system.","a storage area network system has host computers , front -

"the copolymer of the present invention is preferably prepared by esterification of at least 50 mole % of the free anhydride groups in the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer with hydroxy alkyl ( meth ) acrylates, and less than 50 mole % of the free anhydride groups with caprolactone or alkoxy containing hydroxy ( meth ) acrylates. in order to assure nearly all of anhydride is opened, the reaction is preferably carried out with an excess of hydroxyl groups. the reaction of the anhydride and hydroxyl monomers is usually carried out in the presence of organic solvents. typical solvents used for liquid photo - resist systems are propylene glycol mono methyl ether, propylene glycol mono methyl ether acetate, butyl ether glycol acetate, and butyl carbitol acetate. the solvent is typically first charged into a glass vessel and heated slowly to 60 c. at this temperature a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer may be added along with polymerisation inhibitors to prevent thermal polymerisation of the ( meth ) acrylate unsaturation. typical inhibitors used are hydroquinone and its derivatives triphenyl antimony, and trionyl phenyl phosphine. the hydroxyl ( meth ) acrylate monomer may then be added into the copolymer solution in the vessel. the temperature can then be increased to 90 c. to 100 c., and held until nearly all the anhydride groups are opened. complete reaction can be established when the acid value of the reaction product nearly equals the acid value of the semi - ester. two different methods may be used to prepare the copolymer. the first is by reacting the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer separately with two different types of hydroxyl ( meth ) acrylates, and then blending these two different copolymers such that the mixture contains partial esterification products of the styrene maleic anhydride with two different hydroxyl ( meth ) acrylates. the second method is to react the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer simultaneously with two different hydroxyl ( meth ) acrylates. a typical structure of a copolymer of the invention is : ( i. e. either divalent substituent may be attached to either the n or c atoms of the n - substituted carbamoyl moiety ) where m, r 2, r 3 and r 4 are as given herein ( except r 2 is divalent ) and preferably m is 1 ; e, f, g and / or h preferably independently represent 1 or greater, more preferably an integer from 1 to 7 ( inclusive ) ; and k and l independently represent 0 or an integer from 1 to 7 ( inclusive ). more preferably when l is from 1 to 7 then r is a divalent alkyl ester or divalent alkyl ether moiety. styrene maleic anhydride copolymers are commercially available resins such as sma resins from elf atochem, and leumal resins from leuna harze gmbh. the preferred styrene maleic anhydride copolymer resins has molecular weight between 1000 and 30, 000 and a mole ratio of styrene to maleic anhydride in the respective range of about ( 1 to 1 ) to about ( 3 to 1 ). examples of suitable hydroxyl alkyl ( meth ) acrylates for partial esterification with the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer are 2 - hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 - hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 - hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxylpropyl methacrylate, n - methylol methacrylamide and n - methylol acrylamide. examples of hydroxyl monomers with more than one ( meth ) acrylate groups are ditrimethylopropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, and dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate.

containing ( meth ) acrylates to sma copolymer adducts are from about ( 1 to 2 ) to about ( 1 to 10 ) and more preferably from about ( 1 to 3 ) to about ( 1 to 6 ). it is not essential that all the maleic anhydride rings of the copolymer are reacted with ( meth ) acrylate monomers. for example, minor amounts of amine or hydroxyl containing moieties may be used to form non ( meth ) acrylate amide or ester side chains respectively. these side chains may influence the overall solubility of the copolymer composition, especially in dilute alkaline solutions. an example of a possible non ( meth ) acrylate side chain is methoxy polyethyleneglycol. another example is an alkanolamine of formula honr 2 r 3 as well as an amido alcohol of formula ho ( nhco ) m r 2 ; where r 2 and / or r 3 may be independently alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl and m is 1 or greater. the radiation curable composition in this invention are useful in liquid photo -

"embodiments of the invention provide for a method, data processing system and computer program product for dynamic selection of a runtime classloader for a generated class file. in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, script disposed within source code conforming to a language for a container in a modular application execution environment such as osgi can be translated into additional source code conforming to the language for the container and compiled into a container class object. meta - data additionally can be written to the compiled container class object. the meta - data can include, for example, versioning information for the container. thereafter, at run - time the meta - data for the container class object can be read and a corresponding container can be selected based upon the meta - data. finally, the container class object can be loaded into the selected container using a classloader for the selected container. in this way, consistency can be maintained between the container used for translation and compilation and the container used for execution. in further illustration, fig1 pictorially shows a process for dynamic selection of a runtime classloader for a generated class file. as shown in fig1, source code 110 compliant with a programming language native to a container 130 can include script 120 in a language not native to the container 130. the script 120 can be translated within the container 130 into programming language native to the container 130 and embedded within the source code 110. thereafter, the source code 110 can be compiled into compiled code 140 such as a class file for subsequent execution. of note, meta - data 150 can be included with the compiled code 140 to form executable object 160. the meta - data 150 can include an identification of the container 130 including versioning information. at runtime, container selection data processing system 200 can extract the meta - data 150 from the executable object 160. using the meta - data 150, the container selection data processing system 200 can determine a most appropriate container 180 amongst a pool of containers 170 for use in deploying the executable object 160 for execution. thereafter, the selected container 180 can be used to deploy the executable object 160. consequently, companion bundles of components requisite to the proper operation of the executable object 160 can be assured when those bundles vary depending upon the container 130 used for the translation of the script 120 and compilation of the source code 110 into the compiled code 140. in further illustration, fig2 schematically shows a data processing system configured for dynamic selection of a runtime classloader for a generated class file. the system can include a host computer 210 including at least one processor and memory. an operating system 220 can execute in the memory by at least one of the processors of the computer 210. the operating system 220 during execution can host the operation of a modular component execution environment 230 such as that configured to manage the execution of an osgi application of different bundles of class objects. of note, an object repository 250 of different executable objects 240 can be coupled to the computer 210 and accessible by the module component execution environment 230. in this regard, the different executable objects 240 can be aggregated together into one or more bundles and deployed into different containers for execution and management by the modular component execution environment 230. to facilitate in the selection of the different containers into which different executable objects 240 are to be deployed and loaded by corresponding classloaders, dynamic container selection logic 300 can be coupled to the modular component execution environment 230. the dynamic container selection logic 300 can include program code that when executed by at least one processor of the computer 210, can identify in a selected one or more of the executable objects 240 selected for execution, meta - data pertaining to the container used to translate script into source code native to the container, and to compile the source code into an executable object. for instance, the meta - data can include versioning information for the container. the program code further when executed can use the meta - data to select a container into which a selected one of the executable objects 240 is to be deployed so as to ensure compatibility between the selected one of the executable objects and the chosen container, and also to assure the contemporaneous execution of companion components requisite to the operation of the selected one of the executable objects in the selected container. in yet further illustration of the operation of the dynamic container selection logic 300, fig3 is a flow chart illustrating a process for dynamic selection of a runtime classloader for a generated class file. beginning in block 310, a directive can be received in a container to compile source code conforming to a programming language of the container. in block 320, an embedded script can be identified within the source and in block 330 the embedded script can be translated to conform to the programming language. thereafter, in block 340, the source code with translated embedded script can be compiled into a program object. in block 350, meta - data identifying the container and its version can be written to the program object and in block 360, the program object can be saved as part of a component assembly. in block 370, a directive can be received to load and execute the component assembly. in response, in block 380 the program object can be loaded and in block 390, the meta - data can be extracted from the program object. in block 400, a particular container can be selected for hosting the operation of the program object according to the container and container version of the meta - data. additionally, in block 410, supporting components such as dependencies can be located and loaded into the particular container based upon the container and container version of the meta - data. finally, in block 420 the classloader for the particular container can be used to load the program object for execution in the particular container. as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment ( including firmware, resident software, micro -

"in the form of the invention illustrated in the drawings and described hereinafter, a high resolution, deep submergence, towed sonar apparatus 10 comprises a hydrodynamically streamlined and pressure resistant housing, generally indicated at 12, that is adapted to be towed through an aqueous medium by a towing vehicle, such as a surface vessel or a helicopter, through the agency of a towing cable 15. an electrical cable 16 provides for the conduction of electrical power and / or information bearing signals between the towing vehicle and the apparatus 10. housing 12 is characterized by a low, substantially oval profile in side elevation, and is circular in plan, as is best illustrated in fig2. this streamlined housing configuration incorporates what is known as a joukowski streamlined shape and is characterized by a diameter that is, or is close to, twice the thickness thereof. housing 12, which is preferably formed principally of a rigid, solid material such as aluminum, includes a central portion 12a and top and bottom lid members or covers 12b and 12c. referring now to fig3 central portion 12a comprises a central frame 16 having a planar center wall or web 18 that is generally circular in plan. extending in opposite directions, upwardly and downwardly from web 18, are central posts 20 and a plurality of annular, radially spaced, and coaxial ribs 22, 24, and 26. the outermost ribs 26 are conveniently provided with radially extending flanges 28. mounted on the outer surfaces of ribs 26, between flanges 28 and an extending portion of web 18, are a plurality of electroacoustic transducers 30. these transducers are arranged in rows as a peripheral array and are adapted to project and / or receive acoustical energy. suitable waterproof compound, such as an epoxy resin, is advantageously used between adjacent ones of the transducers and between the transducers and the flanges 28. openings 32 are provided through ribs 26 to pass electrical conductors to various electronic elements housed in housing 12. disposed in overlying relation to the array of transducers 30 is a hydrodynamic fairing 34, which in this example serves also as an acoustic window. fairing 34 is preferably formed of a suitable waterproof, and solid plastic material such as neoprene rubber, acrylic resin, polyurethane, or the like, having a desired acoustic transmission capability. the surface 36 of fairing 34 is curved to provide a more hydrodynamically efficient shape to the central portion 12a of housing 12 than would be achieved without its presence. additionally, the index of refraction of the material of fairing 34, together with the curvature of surface 36 thereof, can in some applications be selected according to well understood principals to cause the fairing to serve also as an acoustic lens. covers 12b and 12c are identical in this example, each comprising a concavo - convex wall portion 40 having the convex surface thereof facing outwardly of the housing 12. extending inwardly from each wall portion 38 are a central post 40 and a plurality of annular, radially spaced and coaxial ribs 42, 44 and 46 corresponding in diameters to ribs 22, 24 and 26, respectively of central frame 16. the outermost ribs 46 are of sufficient width to present an annular mating surface that is substantially congruent with the corresponding rib 26 and flange 28 thereof. a plurality of releasable fastening elements in the form of screws 50 extend through apertures in the periphery of covers 12b and 12c and are threadedly engaged in the respective flanges 28. covers 12b and 12c are thereby readily assembled or removed. a resiliently pliable o - ring 52 is recessed into the edge of each rib 26 and cooperates with the opposing rib 46 to provide a water and pressure resistant seal between the covers and the central portion of housing 12. it will be seen that the cooperating, radially spaced ribs of the covers and the central frame provide cover wall to cover wall load bearing support, appropriately distributed to lend great crush resistance to the housing 12 in spite of the thinness of the walls thereof. it will also be seen that the cooperating ribs define a plurality of annular, radially spaced and coaxial chambers 60, 62, and 64 within housing 12 and on opposite sides of web 18. chambers 60, 62, and 64 accommodate electronic components or elements represented by blocks 70 of various geometrical form. these components may include, for example, amplifiers, sonar beam forming signal processors, information signal multiplexers, and other electronic devices well known in their association with sonar or other underwater instrumentations. housing 12 is adapted to be attached to cable 14, for towing, by the provision of a pair of spaced, apertured ears 74 extending from ribs 26 to form a clevis. a clevis pin 76 extends through the ears 74 and through the eye of a cable end fitting 78. electrical cable 15 extends through an appropriate penetration seal 80 in rib 26 to the interior of housing 12, for connection to one or more of the electronic elements 70 therein. any well known hull penetration seal may be used, for example potting material poured around the cable at its point of emergence. the central frame 16 and the covers 12a, 12b can, because of their circular symmetry, be manufactured by turning on a lathe from a solid blank. alternatively they may be readily formed as castings, stampings, or forgings, with mere finishing machining being required. although only one o - ring is shown in the preferred embodiment, it will be recognized that o - rings may be provided between the mating surfaces of others of the ribs to isolate one or more of the chambers 60, 62, 64 from one another. moreover, the cooperating ribs may be increased or decreased in number and / or spacing as the use to which the housing is to be put dictates. obviously, other embodiments and modifications of the subject invention will readily come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing description and the drawing. it is, therefore, to be understood that this invention is not to be limited thereto and that said modifications and embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.","a hydrodynamically streamlined , towable sonar apparatus is described charerized by a housing , including a central frame having a circular planar web portion from which extend a plurality of annular coaxial ribs which cooperate with similar ribs extending inwardly from top and bottom concavo -

"referring to fig1 there is shown a cross sectional view of a prior art h shaped transducer as the type utilized in the prior art. fig1 essentially corresponds to fig3 of the co - pending applications designated as ser. nos. 12 / 077, 637 and 11 / 825, 089. thus, there is shown in fig1 the h shaped transducer as indicated in the above noted applications. the transducer configuration 19 includes a step or flange portion 21 which essentially surrounds the active area or diaphragm area 24. thus the active area 24 is smaller than the active area of prior art devices. by including the step 21 and the smaller diameter active area 24, one now obtains negative stresses at the edges of the diaphragm area 24. thus the step section 21 enables negative stresses to be provided at the periphery of the diaphragm area 24. by measuring the strain, one can obtain an electrical output proportional to the high pressures experienced by the diaphragm. thus as seen in fig1, sensors which are piezoresistive gauges are positioned on the diaphragm 24 as sensors 30, 31, 32 and 33. the sensors are arranged into a full wheatstone bridge which therefore increases the output and accuracy. thus there are two gauges as 30 and 31 which are positioned about the center of the active area 24 and on the gauge side 23. gauges 30 and 31 are both positive operating strain gauges. overlying the step portion 21, which surrounds the active area 24, are gauges 32 and 33. these gauges are negative strain gauges. thus gauges 30, 31, 32 and 33 are wired as a conventional wheatstone bridge to enable one to obtain greater output as well as greater accuracy. the full wheatstone bridge on the transducer responds to pressures up to 60, 000 psi with a large and accurate output. referring to fig2 there is shown a cross sectional view of a typical transducer utilizing the h shaped cross sectional unit of fig1. thus as seen in fig2, the transducer configuration which is the h shaped transducer 19 is welded to the front end of a pressure sensor. the front end of the pressure sensor or pressure transducer has a passageway 52 which allows wires from the gauges on the section 19 to be directed. there is also a threaded portion 53 which mates with a sealing housing section 54. the housing section 54 is coupled to a body 56 or shell which has an internal hollow 55 where compensation / electronics are positioned. there is shown a connector 57 as well. thus the device in depicted in fig2 is mounted as follows : an aperture is provided into which a threaded section 53 is directed. the aperture is also threaded and the h section 19 is then inserted in the aperture while the device is placed in position by means of the thread 53. there would be a compression ring which would co - act with the front edge of the h section header and abuts against the bottom of the aperture to enable a tight seal to be formed between the face of the header 24 and the wall of the aperture. the crush ring or a metal to metal is provided the installing the threaded element 53 behind the sealing header 54. in this manner, a tight seal is provided to prevent leakage. the force required to mate the seal is supplied by installing the threaded element 53 behind the header section as 19. thus the header and seal are placed in compression. experimental data indicates a high zero shift in torque sensitivity which results from this installation technique. the analysis indicates that the face sealing header 19 is placed in compression which in turn compresses or pinches the outer periphery of the thick sensing diaphragm 24 in the h section 19. this pinch causes radial strain in the diaphragm 24 and affects the linearity and zero shift of the pressure sensor. referring to fig3 there is shown a cross sectional view of a h shaped header 61 and a torque isolating outer shell 60. as seen in fig3, there is shown an isolation shell 60. the shell 60 essentially is of a c shaped cross section and has extending arms 72 and 73. the shell has a sealing surface 67, which surface will be pressed against the wall into which the header will be placed, as will be shown and explained. essentially the shell contains an aperture 69 which allows media passage and contains a counterbore 68 which will accommodate a crush ring so that when the unit is placed on a surface or wall, a crush ring which is situated in aperture or depression 68 is forced against the wall in which the transducer is inserted and forms a tight metal seal. essentially the media passage aperture 69 communicates with aperture 65 which is the top aperture in the h shaped header 61. the h shaped header has thick diaphragm 74, the underside of the diaphragm has secured or fixed thereto strain gauges as 63, which strain gauges are conventionally formed in a wheatstone bridge array. essentially the header, which is h shaped, has top arms 75 and 76, which are shorter than the bottom extending arms 78 and 77. as one can see, the h shaped header has a peripheral flange 70 which encircles the top portion of the header. the peripheral flange 70 has a peripheral face 62 which will be welded to the main transducer body. thus as can be seen from fig3, the torque isolation shell 60 surrounds and encloses the h shaped header 61. the walls 73 and 72 of the isolation shell have their ends welded to the peripheral flange 70 associated with the h shaped header 61. as one can ascertain, there is a space 71 between the surfaces of the h shaped header and the top portion. in this manner, the torque isolation shell 60 encloses the pressure sensing h shaped diaphragm member 61 while isolating the section 71 from the installation stresses caused by the face sealing feature. as seen in fig3, the outer shell 60 consists of a cylindrical wall which encloses the h section unit 61. the surface 67 of the shell 60 has a counterbore 68 which will enclose a crush ring. the outer shell 60 acts as a bypass element for the compressive load. the passage 69 through the center allows the sense media to reach the h section diaphragm 74. thus as one can ascertain upon installation, only the crush ring, which is positioned in counterbore 68 and the outer shell 60 experiences compression. there is no installation load on the interior h section 61. accordingly, the installation torque will compress the outer section 60 and the crush ring, and the crush ring forming the high pressure metal to metal seal. the interior h section 61 only experiences stress due to pressure which is directed to the diaphragm via the inlet 69. thus, the unit which is the h shaped configuration 61 will not be affected by the installation torque. referring to fig4 there is shown the torque versus the change in zero shift of the new units as depicted in fig3 by curves 92 and 93 as compared to prior art units as shown as curves 90 and 91. the prior art units, being the unit depicted in fig2. it is seen that the h shaped section shown in fig3 also contains the step concentric flange or rim which essentially is depicted in the above noted co - pending applications and which step portions surrounds the active area of the diaphragm 74. the step of course functions as described in the prior art. referring to fig5 there is shown the composite structure depicted in fig3 consisting of the outer torque isolating shell 60 which is welded at its ends to the h section header portion 61. the ends of the h section header, such as surfaces 62 are welded to a main body 80, which has a threaded portion 84. the main body has a central aperture 81 which accommodates leads and also accommodates the extending pins 64. there is a hex shaped section 82, which hex shaped section enables placement with a wrench. extending from section 82 is a hollowed area which contains the circuit board 83, which is contiguous with a cable release section 86 and cable 85. thus the entire transducer, which contains the isolation shell 60 and the h shaped header 61 is secured to the body 80, which body 80 is threaded by means of a thread portion 84. in this manner, the hex portion 82 is accommodated by suitable wrench, where the entire transducer unit is now placed in a threaded aperture via the threads 84. the aperture communicates with a force transmitting media which essentially passes through the diaphragm 74 of the h section via passageway 69. the same reference numerals have been employed in fig5 to designate corresponding parts as used in fig4. thus as shown, because of the isolation shell 60, the h shaped header 61 experiences no installation load and therefore will only experience stress due to pressure as directed through aperture 69 and not in any manner be affected by the installation torque. as seen in fig4, zero shift is negligible in units which have the header configuration depicted in fig3. referring to fig6 there is shown a typical installation. in fig6, numeral 101 depicts a wall which may be the wall of a combustion engine and so on. the wall has formed therein an aperture 102 which is threaded, and which also has an inlet aperture 106 to allow pressure to enter. the pressure environment 110 may be oil pressure or some other pressure. in any event, the entire transducer assembly as depicted in fig5, is inserted into the aperture 102. it is inserted into the aperture 102 by the thread 84 co - acting with the thread of the aperture and by turning or exerting a torque on the installation hex portion 82 via a tool such as a wrench. as seen by the arrow, the entire unit is rotated by means of the hex wrench or other device so that it is screwed into the aperture 102. the counterbore 68 contains a crush ring 100. as the unit is turned and therefore proceeds to enter the aperture 102, the crush ring 100 is pushed against the inner face of the wall, thus allowing the passageway 106 to communicate with the passageway 69 in the transducer assembly. the torque isolation shell 60 bears the force imparted as the crush ring 100 is pushed against the wall associated with the aperture 106. thus the majority of the torque is experienced by the shell 60 and there is virtually no torque transmitted to the h section header 61. as shown in fig6, only the crush ring 100 and the outer shell 60 experience compression, thus there is no installation load on section 61. the shell 60 is separated from the header 61 by the space 71 and only the flange 70 experiences torque. the crush ring and the outer section form the high pressure metal to metal seal. the wall 101 is conventionally a metal wall and the entire body of the transducer including the isolation shell, the header and so on are also fabricated from metal. thus there is described a torque insensitive header assembly which may be utilized in conjunction with high pressure measurements using h shaped devices having relatively thick diaphragms. it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that there are many alternative embodiments which may be discerned from the figures and descriptions given above and all of which are deemed to be encompassed within the spirit and the scope of the claims appended hereto.","there is disclosed a high pressure sensing header which is relatively insensitive to mounting torque . the header comprises an outer torque isolating shell which surrounds an inner  h  section header . the inner  h  section header has a thick diaphragm and is surrounded by the torque isolating shell which is secured to the  h  section header at a peripheral flange of the  h  section header . in this manner when the header is installed , the installation force is absorbed by the outer shell and there is no installation force or torque exhibited by the inner  h  section which will respond only to stress due to pressure . the torque isolating shell also contains a top surface which has a counterbore that accommodates a crush ring . when the unit is installed , the crush ring is crushed against an installation wall to enable the inner header to receive pressure without experiencing significant installation force ."
"the previously discussed prior art drawing of fig1 illustrates the electric schematic diagram for driving the horizontal or x lines of a core matrix such as shown in fig2. a similar configuration of components is shown in fig3 and represents the vertical or y lines. the core matrix and drive lines shown in fig4 constitute a conventional three - wire coincident current memory system. it is the driver system shown in fig2 and 3 which constitute the invention. referring to fig2 the x line driver system is shown to include a current regulator 1 of conventional design which provides regulated dc current to the transistor driver switches. each driver, such as shown by reference numeral 2, comprises a pair of transistor switches, such as the upper two illustrated transistors qx1h and qx1l. the collector terminals of the source transistor switches qx1h, qx2h, qx3h, qx4h and qx5h are connected to the output bus 10 of the current regulator 1. the emitter terminals of the sink transistor switches qx1l, qx2l, qx3l, qx4l and qx5l are connected to the ground bus line 20. all of the drivers are located to one side of the drive lines 5, 6, 7 and 8. energization of a selected x line occurs when current from a transistor in a driver acts as a source and transmits current through the preselected diode of the diode group such as 9 which routes the source current through a selector x line for return through the diode group 9 to a transistor of another driver which operates in the circuit as a sink. the main design criterion of the present invention is the arrangement of drivers permitting a source transistor in one driver to cooperate with a sink transistor in any of the other drivers thereby permitting population of all of the possible paths between available drivers. the upper half of the diode group 9 has each diode anode connected in common to lead 14, which is in turn connected to the emitter 12 of the corresponding source transistor switch qx1h. the remaining lower half of the diode group 9 has each cathode, connected in common, along lead 16, to the collector 15 of transistor switch qx1l. the drive - lines such as 5, 6, 7 and 8 are connected to opposite terminals of the mentioned diodes to complete a current path between the drivers and the drive - lines. in order to obtain a better comprehension of the present invention, the inventive system will be described in terms of five drivers, each driver including a pair of transistor switches. in the present example, this number of drivers will drive ten lines. however, the specific number of drivers and lines mentioned is merely illustrative and in no way is intended to limit the present invention. generally, the design criteria for the present invention is expressed as follows : # # equ2 # # where n = number of drivers. thus, in the example shown in fig2 where ten drive - lines are to be specified, n = 5, which is the number of drivers needed. it should be borne in mind that each driver includes two transistor switches. the number of necessary diodes per transistor switch is equal to ( n - 1 ). thus, as seen in the example of fig2 four diodes must be connected to each transistor switch of a diode group, such as 9, with the direction of the four diodes associated with transistor switch qx1h being in the reverse direction from those associated with transistor switch qx1l. the nomenclature for each transistor switch is chosen so that it associates with particular driven lines. thus, qx1h controls switching to drive - lines 5, 6, 7 and 8 ( which are hereinafter assigned the nomenclature x12, x13, x14 and x15 ) in a manner permitting source current to flow from the transistor qx1h through the diode group 9 for return to transistor qx1l serving as a sink for the same associated drive - lines. the diode group 9 provides electrical disjunctivity for proper line selection. diode nomenclature in fig2 has been chosen so that the first numeral and the letter which follows the numeral specify the transistor switch with which the particular diode is associated, while the last numeral indicates the other transistor switch associated with the same drive - line. it will be further noted that the two numerals in a particular diode designation considered together in ascending order, specify the particular drive - line. fig3 illustrates the development of the driver system for the vertical or y drive - lines. a square final matrix is assumed so that the numbers of drive - lines, drivers and diodes are identical and identically configured with those shown in fig2 for the horizontal or x lines. thus, the only differences exist in the changes in nomenclature from x to y. the comments made in connection with fig2 are equally appropriate to those of fig3. fig4 illustrates the matrix of cores, on addressable crosspoints, formed by the interweaving of the x and y drive - lines. also shown in the figure is a sense / inhibit lead. a previously mentioned, the matrix shown in fig4 is conventional. in order to appreciate the operation of the present invention, it should be understood that one core at a time is addressed in the matrix of fig4 as is done in the prior art. this, of course, is done by selecting the two drive - lines that intersect at a selected core. however, in order to accomplish this, it is necessary to select the proper drivers which is the task of the present invention. the operation of the invention is best appreciated by considering an example. thus, assume that a core 18 in fig4 is to be addressed. this core is at the intersection of driver lines x35 and y13. the read mode enablement of the proper x drive - line requires that qx3h and qx5l be switched on. transistor switch qx3h serves as a source while transistor qx5l serves as a sink. in order to select drive - line y13, transistor switch qy1h is turned on and serves as a source while transistor qy3l serves as a sink for drive - line y13. the combination of additive half - select currents through the selected core would switch the core to a logic & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; state. if the core was already in the logic & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; state, the flux produced and coupled into the sense / inhibit line of fig4 would be smaller or less than the flux produced if the core were initially at a logic & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; state and then switched to the logic & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; state. in this respect, the core switching operates in the conventional manner. signals of sufficiently different amplitude, which can be easily discriminated between, will be induced in the sense / inhibit line. this occurs during the read mode. the write mode of the memory requires a resetting of the cores addressed to its initial value or to some other, arbitrary value. if the direction of current flow in the two selected drive - lines, in the disclosed example x35 and y13 is now reversed, the core will be switched from a logic & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; to a logic & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; value because of the additive effect of the two half - select currents. if it is desired to maintain the core at a logic & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; state, it is necessary to inject an opposing half - select current into the sense / inhibit winding, where it will be subtracted from the combined currents and flux of the x35 and y13 lines. this prevents the core from switching. in order to have reversed the current flow directions in lines x35 and y13, it would be necessary to have first turned transistor switches qx3h, qx5l, qy1h and qy3l off, and then have switched transistor switches qx3l, qx5h, qyll and qy3h on. as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, pnp transistors may be used in lieu of the npn transistors as shown in fig2 and 3. likewise, the current regulators 1 may be placed in different parts of the circuit. for example, they may be placed along the ground bus lines 20 ( fig2 ) and 22 ( fig3 ). other variations of this include the addition of different types of line bias networks. it should also be noted that the cores may be wound in the coincident current mode or in the anti - coincident current mode, or in both modes, simultaneously, as is presently done in the advanced state of the art systems. this latter method doubles the number of cores that can be uniquely addressed by a given number of drivers. it is also noted that fig4 shows only one of the many possible ways to wind or thread the core planes. the sense / inhibit line could be positioned either vertically or horizontally, instead of diagonally, as shown in the figure, or in some combination thereof to best balance out flux build - ups. accordingly, the construction of the present core memory driver system permitting any two drivers to cooperate with each other as a source - sink combination results in maximum utilization of the drivers thereby generally permitting fewer drivers to be employed in the selection of drive - lines. it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction shown and described herein for obvious modifications will occur to persons skilled in the art.",the complexity of a memory driver system is decreased by minimizing the number of half - select current driver circuits and corresponding terminals and wires connected between the driver lines and the core stack . this is effected by maximizing the number of current paths between memory drivers .
"the embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to its preferred application to the display of digital images of both breasts supplied by mammography apparatus. these images can be images acquired digitally for subsequent digital processing for their display. the images can also be obtained from analog radiography apparatus by exposure and development of films. the analog images can then be digitized and displayed as discussed below. fig1 shows diagrammatically images 2 and 4 of both breasts displayed in a known apparatus. the first image 2 shows the right - hand breast of a patient in a cranio - caudal view. the second image 4 shows the patient & # 39 ; s left - hand breast in a cranio - caudal view. both images are displayed side by side, the first image being to the left of the second image. the respective contours 6 and 8 of the breasts are shown diagrammatically on their images 2 and 4. on the images 2 and 4, regions of interest 10 and 12 defined around the breasts can also be seen. as explained above, each region of interest is formed by a rectangle surrounding the breast. this rectangle has, taking into account a margin surrounding the breast, a small as possible surface area. in fig1, the views of the breasts on the first and second images are offset. the right - hand breast shown on die first image is higher up than the view of the left - hand breast on the second image. the height dimension with reference to fig1 as well as to the remaining drawings refers to a dimension on the images taken along their adjacent edge. because of the offset, it is difficult for the practitioner to compare the two images. the offset can simply originate from the manner in which each breast was positioned when the images were taken. the offset can also originate from a difference in size of the two breasts. fig2 shows diagrammatically images of the two breasts displayed according to one embodiment of the invention. as in fig1, the images are two cranio - caudal images, and the same reference numerals have been used to identify the same elements. fig2 also shows the region of interest surrounding the breast on each image ; it can be seen that the region of interest is at the same height on each image. in other words, the regions of interest of the left - and right - hand images are aligned. consequently, as fig2 shows, the two breasts are displayed at the same height on the two images. the right - hand breast shown on the first image 2 is at the same height as the view of the left - hand breast on the second image 4. such a display facilitates the comparison of the images of both breasts. the display shown in fig2 can be obtained as follows. images of both breasts are acquired. as explained above, these may originate directly from apparatus fitted with a digital acquisition unit, or from a unit for digitizing analog images. a region of interest is defined on each image around the view of the patient & # 39 ; s breast on the image. definition of such a region of interest is described in the following european patent applications : ep - a - 1, 047, 018, ep - a - 1, 035, 507 or ep - a - 0, 912, 963. definition of such a region of interest is performed on the image using digital image processing techniques. once the region of interest has been defined on each image, the images are displayed so that the regions of interest are aligned. as fig2 shows, for regions of interest of the same size in the vertical direction, alignment is performed by displaying the upper or lower edge of the regions of interest of the images at the same height. the digital images can be displayed on the same display apparatus such as a cathode ray tube, a liquid crystal display or any other type of display device. the images can also be displayed on two separate display devices side by side. whatever type of device is used for display, the two digital images are displayed side by side for comparison purposes wherein the regions of interest are aligned to simplify comparison. fig3 shows diagrammatically other images displayed according to an embodiment of the invention. the images on fig3 are side view images of a patient & # 39 ; s breasts in a mammograph ; the same reference numerals have been employed. fig3 shows that the breast shown in the first image 2 is larger than the view of the breast on the second image 4 of fig3. this size difference can simply originate from differing manipulations when taking the images. in the embodiment of fig3, the right - hand breast may have been positioned differently from the left - hand breast when the images were taken. two arrows 16 and 14 can also be seen on the images 2 and 4 and these indicate the respective positions of the tip of the breast on each image. in the embodiment of fig3, the position of the tip of the breast is used for aligning the regions of interest on the two images. the position of the tip of the breast can be detained using known image analysis techniques. for the alignment, the height in the image of this tip of the breast can simply be used. more generally, where the regions of interest of both images are not of the same size in the vertical direction, one can, for alignment purposes, optimize one image - dependent criterion, as a function of the relative height of the images. such a criterion can be the result of computing correlation over the whole of the region of interest, or over a part of this region of interest. one could also proceed to correlate images in the area adjoining the tip of the breast. one could also proceed to align the contour of a breast or part of the contour of one breast with respect to the other breast. such computations allow determination of the relative height for which this criterion is at its maximum ; this height now corresponds to alignment of the regions of interest on both images. the result, shown in fig3, is that the images are, like in fig2, displayed so as to facilitate their comparison. the technique described with reference to fig3 is particularly useful when the regions of interest determined for the two images are not of the same size. they are now aligned by calculating an optimization criterion which depends on the relative position of the images, after which this criterion is optimized. fig4 shows diagrammatically images displayed in another embodiment of the invention. in the embodiment of fig4, not only are the regions of interest aligned, but also the images are enlarged. the same magnification factor is applied to both the images to still ensure ready comparison of each image. the magnification factor is calculated as a function of the size of the region of interest on the first image and the size of the region of interest on the second image. the magnification factor, common to both images is selected so that the region of interest of each image is wholly contained within each displayed image. in other words, the enlargement enables the complete breast to be seen on the image displayed. in the example of fig3, the region of interest on the image of the right - hand breast occupies a greater area than the region of interest on the image of the left - hand breast. the magnification factor to obtain the display shown in fig4 is calculated using the region of interest of the first image. in fig4, the region of interest of the first image consequently touches the upper and lower edges of the image. in contrast, for the same magnification factor, the region of interest of the second image is not touching the edges of the second image. both images are nevertheless displayed with the same magnification factor which facilitates their comparison. this technique also applies to regions of interest of the same size. fig5 is a flow chart for carrying out the display method, for the two images. steps 18 22 concern the first image and steps 19 23 the second image ; and steps 24 to 32 constitute joint processing of both images. in a first step 18, the digital image of a breast is acquired. as explained above, acquisition can be of any type. acquisition can comprise the application of numerous processing operations to the images, for example sensor correction processing operations, and operations for thickness compensation, automatic contrast setting or otherwise. at the next step 20, a region of interest is defined in the image. next, at step 22, it is determined whether enlargement of the image is desirable. if so, processing passes to step 24 and, in the opposite case, to step 28. steps 19, 21 and 23 correspond to steps 18, 20 and 22 for the second image. at step 23, like step 22, it is determined whether enlargement of the image is desirable and if so, control passes to step 24 or, in the opposite case, to step 28. showing the flow chart with two separate branches is simply designed to demonstrate that image processing in these steps is independent. processing can obviously be performed successively using identical apparatus as would be the case for images taken successively in the same apparatus. response at steps 22 and 23 can be pre - programmed for a given display protocol or can result from user input. at step 24, a magnification factor is calculated. this factor is a minimum of the ratio between image size and region of interest size. the minimum on both images, in both directions is considered. the magnification factor obtained will ensure that the region of interest of each image is wholly contained within the enlarged image. at the next step 26, each image is enlarged by applying the calculated magnification factor. control then passes to step 28 where the two regions of interest are aligned. at step 30, both images are displayed with their regions of interest aligned. the process then stops at step 32. it can obviously be repeated for other images. fig6 shows image display apparatus. the apparatus has a unit for acquiring digital images 34. this unit is for example an image sensor of digital apparatus, or a unit for digitizing analog images or, yet again, a unit for receiving storage media containing a digital image. the acquisition unit could also be simply comprised of storage media such as a hard disk. the acquisition unit supplies an image processing unit 36 with at least two digital images intended for simultaneous display. image processing unit 36 processes the images and applies the processed images to a display device 38. as explained above, the display device can be of any type whatsoever. image processing unit 36 can consist of a pc ( personal computer ), an image processing board including a microprocessor, or any other digital computing means known per se. this image processing unit comprises several separate processing blocks. these blocks are for example logic blocks in the processing unit. the first block 40 is responsible for defining a region of interest and defines, in each image received, a region of interest and outputs an image having a region of interest. the images supplied are fed to block 42 for enlargement. block 42 a common magnification factor for the images is calculated ; the images are then enlarged. the enlarged images are applied to block 44 handling alignment. as arrow 46 shows, the images with their region of interest can be applied directly to alignment block 44, bypassing the magnification block. in the alignment block, the regions of interest of the images are aligned. the output is aligned images which are applied to display device 38 for simultaneous display. this diagram does not show processing operations which may be applied to the images but which have no bearing on the method described. obviously, the invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments discussed above ; in particular, it can apply to images other than those of the two breasts in a mammograph ; it can also apply to displaying of images of the same breast taken at different moments. the alignment modes discussed with reference to fig2 for cranio - caudal images also apply to the side views in fig3 and 4 or, yet again, to any type of image. inversely, the alignment modes of fig3 and 4 apply also to images consisting of cranio - caudal images. the region of interest in the example is rectangular but it could have any other shape. in the examples, the enlargement step is performed before the alignment step ; but it can also occur after the alignment step. the examples refer to specific images ; the method disclosed applies to other images as well. the method has also been described based on an example of two images but it can also apply to more than two images. thus, two cranio - caudal images could be displayed simultaneously along with two side view images. in this case, the images could be enlarged using the same magnification factor for the four images. the images could also be aligned pairwise. the examples discuss images displayed side by side. the method can also be applied to images displayed one above the other with the dimension of interest no longer being the vertical dimensions, but rather horizontal dimensions. various modifications in structure and / or steps and / or function may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope and extent of the invention as recited in the claims.","the regions of interest of images of both breasts of a patient are defined as regions of the image of minimal surface area and containing views of the breasts . these regions of interest are aligned for simultaneous display of the images . the display now allows simple and direct comparison of the images of both breasts , notably allowing immediate comparison of structural disorganizations within the two breasts ."
"an autonomous personal service robot will now be described. in the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. it will be apparent, however, to an artisan of ordinary skill that the present invention may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. in other instances, specific features, quantities, or measurements well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. readers should note that although examples of the invention are set forth herein, the claims, and the full scope of any equivalents, are what define the metes and bounds of the invention. referring to fig1, one embodiment of the pra includes basic monitoring functions with limited safety and convenience features. pra 100 includes frame 101 which may be either open or closed. the figure shows a closed design, which hides most of the robot & # 39 ;

high tech or futuristic ; or anthropomorphic to better convey the idea of a companion. the design and shape of each pra is based on the target market. in one embodiment, the pra is round when looking at it from the top. this shape enables the robot to turn in place enabling it to get out of any position and minimizing the chance for it to get stuck. other shapes may also be used, but use different navigation software and algorithms. another factor affecting the overall shape is stability. if the robot is tall it may be prone to tipping over if people lean on it. such an embodiment may utilize weight near the base or a drive system optimized for stability. larger robots are more stable and have space to house various features, but a larger size makes it more difficult to navigate through cluttered rooms or narrow openings. users of the system may therefore opt for one model over the other based on their particular environment. the drive system includes two independent drive wheel assemblies 102 located symmetrically on either side and at the center of the robot. each drive wheel operates independently enabling the robot to move forward and backward. if they are turning in opposite directions, the pra rotates in place. if they are going in the same direction, but at different speeds, the pra turns along an arc. this embodiment uses one or more casters or skid plates 103 to provide stability. each wheel is large enough to enable the pra to climb the thresholds and floor transitions in a typical house. the wheel itself may be a single part, an assembly including a hub and a rubber rim or any other wheel configuration. each wheel is turned by an electric motor powered by a battery, not shown. alternatively, the robot could be powered by a fuel cell or other means. utilizing a two drive wheel system enables the pra to turn in place, further minimizing the chances of getting stuck. a typical automotive or remote control car drive system uses a single motor to spin two wheels ( either the front or the rear ) while a second, motor or servo turns the wheels around the vertical axis. this and other drive configurations may also be used on the pra. while being simpler to implement, this configuration does not have as much maneuverability as the two drive wheel configuration. alternatively, treads can be used instead of the drive wheels and casters in a design similar to a tank. another embodiment may utilize a drive mechanism known as a holonomic drive wheel system. this system is a three drive wheel system using omni wheels where each wheel is located at 120 degrees relative to the other wheels and is driven by a motor. an omni - wheel is a wheel that can turn around two perpendicular axes simultaneously. transverse spinning mini - wheels are arranged around the perimeter of the main angle of motion. these side spinning wheels enable the main wheel to spin in a direction other than the direction of motion without dragging. using proper control algorithms, the three wheels can be used to make the vehicle go in virtually any direction including directly sideways. regardless of the specific drive implementation, the system may further comprise providing encoder data, indicative of movement of the pra. the pra uses cmos or ccd cameras as sensors to see the environment. in one or more embodiments, the pra uses one pair of stereo cameras 104. multiple pairs of cameras may be used in other embodiments. adding cameras increases the amount of information the navigation system can use when navigating, which might enable it to better map and manipulate through cluttered areas. the cameras in this embodiment are rotated 45 degrees with respect to the pra & # 39 ; s direction of travel, roll. one or more embodiments of the invention may utilize a single camera, or may utilize a pair of cameras horizontally mounted, vertically mounted or mounted at any angle between horizontal or vertical ( between 0 and 90 degrees ) with respect to the horizontal. the benefit of the angled axis feature is described in the inventors co - pending application ser. no. 10 / 710, 512 entitled angled axis machine vision system and method, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. in addition, the pra system may include a base - station, not shown. this robot docks on the base - station, which is plugged into the wall to charge. in addition, the base - station may include a connection to the internet or a wireless telephone base. the base station may comprise inductive charging allowing for the pra to locate itself on or near the base station and charge without physically connecting to the base station through a hard wire connection. one embodiment of the pra includes reading light 105. the robot may also use this light to help it navigate through dark rooms. the top of pra 106 in this embodiment is a tray, which may be used by its owner to transport objects. for example, an elderly or disabled person might be able to make a meal or a snack, but may be unable to carry it to a different room if they use a walker or wheel chair. in this embodiment the user may place food on the tray, and the pra then may follow the user to a dining area. other people might use this feature because they have too much for them to carry in one trip. the pra may also comprise telephone 107. this is one means for the robot to communicate with the owner & # 39 ; s family, doctors or emergency services. the pra comprises user interface ( ui ) 108 for communicating with its owners. the ui may include a pixel - type lcd screen capable of showing pictures or video, or just a text display. it may also include a speaker for voice communication. in order to input commands, the ui may use a micro - phone and voice activated controls, a touch screen or a keypad. the display and speakers may be used for functions other than just controls such as showing television or videos or for reading audio books. the pra may include safety, medical or convenience features such as medicine dispenser 109 shown in the figure. in addition to the cameras used for navigation, the pra may include one or more additional cameras 110 to track and monitor its owner. these cameras identify a person using algorithms to recognize the owner & # 39 ; s face, gate, clothes, voice, routines, etc, and track them as they move throughout the house. it is important for the robot to be able to identify and track its owner if there are multiple people in the house. for example, these software routines enable the pra to determine whether it is the owner or the guest that has left. if the owner remains, everything runs as normal. if the owner leaves, the owner & # 39 ; s routines and schedules that the pra has learned are not applicable to the remaining individual and the system may be programmed not to track them at all. while the navigation cameras may track the person, dedicated cameras may be located in a better position to see the person. such a position may be higher than the navigation cameras as in the embodiment shown in the figure. the cameras may also use a different focal length or include an adjustable zoom to enable the pra to accurately track the person from a variety of distances. in addition, the dedicated cameras may move, rotate and look up - an - down, so it can keep the person without having to move the entire robot. in addition, the user may utilize an rfid tag in order to aid in the tracking of the user. environmental conditions may affect both the navigation and monitoring cameras & # 39 ; ability to analyze images to extract information. various features enhance the robot & # 39 ; s functional ability in these conditions. for example, a light enables the robot to better see in the dark. the robot could include an infra - red light which is invisible to humans. the pra could shine this light at their owner to add in tracking and monitoring without blinding them. another condition which may impair the robot & # 39 ; s performance is when the environment includes both very bright and very dark areas, which can overwhelm the dynamic range of digital cameras and other image sensors. the robot will have difficulty recognizing its owner if they are sitting in front of a light or bright window, which is something people like to do. the pra may incorporate algorithms described in the inventor & # 39 ; s pending patent application ser. no. 10 / 100, 221 entitled system and method to increase the effective dynamic range of image sensors which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. the robot also includes both high level and low level electronics, not shown. the high level electronics could be a standard personal computer, other micro - processor, dsp or other system enabling the pra to process the information from the cameras and other sensors for navigation, monitoring and task performance. the processor may be internally mounted in the frame of the pra or externally located and communicate through a communications interface coupled with the pra. the low level electronics may include a pic or other micro - processor to control individual mechanical features such as providing a pulse width modulating pwm signal the power to enable the drive mechanism to work at a variety of speeds ; to turn on and off lights ; to read encoder information from the wheels ; etc. in another embodiment, the high - and low - level electronics are incorporated into a single electrical package. in still another embodiment, a remote personal computer networked to the pra performs the functions of the high level electronics. fig2 shows an alternative embodiment for a monitoring - only pra. this embodiment 200 includes a housing 201, and stereo cameras for navigation 202, a camera for tracking the owner 203 and a user interface 204. while the embodiment shown in fig1 is approximately the size of a small table, roughly 18 inches in diameter and 24 - 36 inches tall, the embodiment shown in fig2 is significantly smaller, roughly 14 inches in diameter and 12 inches tall. the small size makes it more maneuverable through a house and enables the robot to be less intrusive because it could position itself virtually out of sight. this embodiment employs a tread system 205 instead of wheels, but, like the larger version, could incorporate any of several different drives. the smaller pra also has a light 206 and a telephone 207. because the robot is small, it relies on voice communication and has a powered speaker 208 and a remote control 209 which the owner may carry. the smaller pra also recharges at its base - station, not shown. sensitized bumpers or touch sensors may be incorporated either partially or totally around the perimeter of the pra and may extend its full height, length and width. the bumpers detect whether the robot runs into an object in the room. these touch sensors or other sensors, which may be incorporated into the pra, serve to augment the camera system by providing additional information regarding the environment, the owner or the state of the pra to aid in mapping, tracking, navigation and task performance. in order to appeal to some of the elderly population, the pra is extremely user friendly, non - threatening and easy to install. the setup procedure is shown in fig3. in one embodiment, the robot monitoring system comes in two parts, the pra and the base - station. the hardware setup comprises connecting the base station to a power plug and telephone outlet 301 and positioning the pra on the base - station to charge 302. other embodiments that derive power without a base station are in keeping with the spirit of the invention and these embodiments may comprise use of a wireless link on the pra instead of directing communications through a base station. the user programs emergency contacts such as family members or doctors 303 either into the base station or into the pra depending on the embodiment. depending on the features included in the pra, there may be no other setup required. however, some optional features may also require setup and programming 304, for example if the system includes a medicine dispenser it must be filled and the schedule programmed, or rf tags may attached to remote controls, glasses, books or other objects that may be tracked or retrieved by the robot. the pra may include x10 or bluetooth capability to control household lights and appliances that may also require programming. in an alternative embodiment, the owner wears a radio frequency tag or other beacon to identify themselves to different sensors. in this embodiment, the algorithms required to track the owner are significantly simpler and the robot may be less expensive. however, the beacons become more invasive whether they are a necklace, pin, bracelet or other object, which the owner may either forget or elect not to wear. during setup, these beacons must be put on by the owner. once the robot is charged, it will learn to identify its owner 305, begin to explore the house 306 and begin general operation including tracking and monitoring its owner 307. exploration is the process by which a representation of the environment is created and updated from sensor data and preprogrammed input. there are many well - known systems and algorithms to map and navigate, often collectively referred to as slam or simultaneous localization and mapping any of which may be used in one or more embodiments of the invention. the pra may create and store several maps having different levels of resolution, stability and / or coordinate systems including a probabilistic two - dimensional ( 2d ) or 3d map of the robot & # 39 ; s environment. a static map of the environment & # 39 ; s outer perimeter ( i. e. room walls or yard boundaries ) may also be created. the maps are stored in ram or non - volatile memory. the pra may explore the house before it begins its functional tasks, as it operates or in a combination of the two. previously unmapped areas of the house, such as rooms that had their doors closed will be mapped as they are encountered. parts of the house that have changed may be re - mapped as necessary. the iterative mapping process essentially comprises the steps of moving to a new position, collecting sensor data of the objects and obstacles in the immediately surrounding area, performing localization, and updating the map to incorporate information derived from the new sensor data. during exploration and the pra & # 39 ; s general operation, the robot identifies objects, such as certain pieces of furniture, and rooms 308 to provide additional information used in monitoring or performing functions. for example, the robot will understand the basic characteristics of a bed and know that beds are found in bedrooms. it may also recognize refrigerators as being part of the kitchen, and couches and chairs as a typical place for a person to sit down. the robot monitors and tracks its owner using a variety of software algorithms such as facial or gate recognition. the owner may also wear a beacon such that the robot may track them even when they are out of sight. using a neural network or other learning algorithms, the pra combines general monitoring rules with owner specific habits to determine whether the owner is in trouble. for example, people generally sleep at night in the bedroom. the pra will observe that the owner typically goes to bed at 10 and wakes at 7 the next morning. if the owner has not gotten out of bed by 9 or 10, the robot may attempt to wake them or call one of the emergency contacts. similarly, the pra will recognize a bathroom and understand that people may spend some period of time taking a shower with the door closed. it will recognize that its owner may have a problem if they remain in the bathroom for some period of time greater than normal. the process of learning and adapting the monitoring system is iterative and one or more embodiments of the invention update and refine the operational plan and emergency thresholds and response 309. there are many well known localization and navigation algorithms that may be incorporated into the pra. the speed and accuracy at which the robot may be able to move through a room is determined by the task requirements and the computational power of the high level electronics. generally, the most computationally intensive part of localization is for the mobile robot to track its own position as it moves. one embodiment of the pra uses cameras as the primary ( optical ) sensors. the pra tracks its position using dead reckoning combined with any combination of one or more localization algorithms utilizing landmarks or other available information. other embodiments can use sonar, radar, lidar, and infrared sensors, in addition to, or in place of the optical sensors. similarly, the pra can use any known localization method or a combination of methods rather than the dead reckoning and landmark recognition described above. in monitoring a person, the robot will generally follow and / or observe them from a distance. therefore, it may not be essential that it precisely know its location. the key criteria may be that it moves quickly while avoiding obstacles. in this embodiment, the pra does not need an accurate map and may operate in rooms for which it has not previously explored. this system would require less computational capacity to travel at the same speed as a version of the system that localizes to a greater precision. the process of monitoring a person primarily using vision is described in fig4. during the initial setup, the pra learns to recognize its owner 401. the pra is introduced to its owner either directly by its owner, or with the help of an assistant. this involves having the user or patient look into the tracking, and / or monitoring cameras for a few seconds while moving their head naturally. additionally, the robot may watch and listen to the person while they are engaged in conversation. the pra may also watch the person walk to learn their gate. optionally, the owner may wear a beacon that may have a distinctive appearance or send out a radio signal. finally, the pra can recognize its owner by its clothes. during its introduction it identifies the color and pattern of the clothes its owner is wearing, which it will track. the pra observes the clothing each time it sees its owner and updates the clothing list in case the person has changed clothes. after the introduction, the pra is ready to begin its normal tracking and monitoring operation 402. there are several simple and well know motion tracking algorithms for following the person. use of more than one robot in performing functions is described in the inventors & # 39 ; u. s. pat. no. 6, 374, 155 entitled autonomous multi - platform robot system which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. using more than one robot to share user status, environment status or mapping information is in keeping with the spirit of the instant invention. the robot monitors its owner based on his / her position, and facial, voice, gate and clothing recognition. should the robot determine a potentially crisis condition 403, it will attempt to confirm by interacting with its owner or notify monitoring service 404 if an emergency situation is determined to exist. for example, if the person is mostly stationary, the robot may find an out of the way spot to watch him / her. depending on time of day and position of patient, there is a threshold that could indicate an emergency if the person is completely still or mostly still for longer than some thresholds. should the person remain still beyond the thresholds, the pra will attempt to interact, notify the monitoring service and / or other emergency contacts with which it has been programmed. the pra monitors its owner in normal mode until it has detected the need to confirm the identity or reacquire tracking. there are several situations that might cause the pra to lose track of its owner 406. the person has moved to a spot where the robot cannot see him / her. the person may go outside, go into a different room and shut the door, go up or down stairs, or move into another area where the robot does not have access for any other reason. after the robot determines that it has lost track of its owner 406, it goes into acquire search mode 407. the robot searches the patient & # 39 ; s home every so often to attempt to find the patient. searching continues until a human is found. objects are recognized as humans using one of the many standard recognition algorithms. once a human is encountered, the pra uses facial, gate and last known clothing recognition to determine whether the person is its owner. if so, the robot begins tracking and monitoring its owner. if the face is not the face of its owner, the current search is aborted and is retried later. if the system includes voice recognition, or the person is wearing a beacon, those signals may be used to augment the search and recognition algorithms. based on the map of the house and the habits that the robot has learned, the pra may vary its search routine. if the person has gone into an area, which the robot believes has no other exit, the pra positions itself at that area as much as possible and patrol less frequently. this is the situation if the person enters room and closes door. the pra will give its owner privacy, but will also keep track of how long he / she is in the room and notify the monitoring service if patient doesn & # 39 ; t come back out for a certain length of time. also, the pra will attempt to determine whether the disappearance is part of a known routine, such as showering, sleeping or even leaving the house to get the newspaper or groceries. if it is a known behavior, the robot will also alter its search algorithms in order to optimize the likelihood of reacquiring its owner at the end of the activity while still providing for finding them if the current disappearance is in fact not the known behavior. visitors in the house may also cause the robot to lose track of its owner. when people come to visit the patient 408, the robot will generally position itself out - of - the - way such that it can watch the people. from this position, the robot may not be able to continuously monitor its owner. because there are other people present, the pra & # 39 ; s algorithms may assume the visitors are capable of recognizing an emergency and allow less direct monitoring of its owner. as long as the robot may detect more than one person or a great deal of movement, it may remain in this visitor mode 409. when the movement ceases, or the guest apparently leaves, the pra goes checks if owner tracking is lost 406 and possibly to acquire search mode 407. once its owner is detected and recognized, the robot returns to normal tracking and monitoring 402. in addition to monitoring individuals, the pra may perform a wide variety of other tasks. a partial list of service functions is shown in fig5. the services that the pra may provide include the monitor functions 501 partially described above. while some of these functions may appeal to many individual and to parents with young children, these functions are targeted at supporting the elderly and infirmed. this group of individuals often requires specialized medical attention that the pra may also provide 502. for example, the robot may house a medicine dispenser that tracks when medication is due and brings it to the person regardless of their location. this service eliminates the problem of the person simply forgetting to take their medication. the pra could also track compliance and report it to a doctor, nurse or other caregiver. this compliance monitoring is important because research shows that 50 % or more of the elderly patients either unintentionally or knowingly do not comply with their medication schedule. knowing their performance may improve their treatment and health. the pra could also house equipment to test blood pressure or blood sugar as well as providing initial dementia screening and other medical tasks. in one embodiment, the medicine dispenser is a commercially available appliance such as the medport medglider pill reminder and dispenser system. the pill system may be directly linked to the pra to schedule the medicine doses. at the proper time, the robot will approach its owner and remind them of their medication. alternatively, the pra may not communicate directly with the pill reminder / dispenser system. the robot may be programmed directly, or it may recognize the reminders and / or alarms integrated into the system. one function of the monitor is to contact a caregiver if there is an emergency. the telephone may also have other uses 503. the pra may simply house a standard telephone. since the robot may always be near its owner, the phone will always be near, so they neither have to find it or even get up to answer a call. any function included in any telephone could also be built into the system. the pra may also be equipped with sensors and programmed to respond to environmental emergencies 504. mobile smoke and carbon monoxide detectors would be located near the household occupants increasing their reliability. a thermometer would enable the pra to detect whether the heat or air conditioning has failed before conditions can become critical. the robot may also act as a mobile sentry to detect intruders. in addition to monitoring and safety features, many people want convenience that the pra may perform tasks similar to those of a personal butler 505. it can detect when it is getting dark and turn on lights. it may include an internet, television or radio connection to act as a personal media center. such a system could download audio books and other media content. adding an arm further increases the pra & # 39 ; s capabilities 506. the robot could then track and pick - up, or retrieve objects such as books, keys, remote controls, etc. the pra could also get food or drink from the refrigerator. the potential tasks are almost unlimited. a pra with an arm is shown in fig6. the pra 600 includes a base unit 601 that may reflect one of the embodiments shown above or have a different design. the arm 602 should be long enough to perform its desired task. in one embodiment, the arm may pick - up objects off the ground, reach wall switches to turn on and off lights, and be able to reach into the refrigerator. if the arm is mounted near the top of a 30 inch tall base, the arm should be at least 3 feet long. the arm could be shorter if it is mounted lower. the end of the arm is equipped with a hand or grabbing mechanism 603, the complexity of which is dependent on the tasks to be performed. if the pra is required to handle delicate objects, a hand comprising significant dexterity may be utilized, but if it only turns on switches, picks up soda cans and books, and finds remote controls or glasses, the hand utilized may be of a simple vise - like design. while the above detailed description has shown, described, and pointed out novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form and details of the device or process illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the intent of the invention. many variations to the basic design are possible in other embodiments. the scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.","autonomous personal service robot to monitor its owner for symptoms of distress and provide assistance . the system may include sensors to detect situations before they affect people such as smoke , heat , temperature and carbon monoxide sensors . the system can provide security for the home . the pra may comprise features such as a medicine dispenser and blood pressure cuff . features such as broadband internet , mp3 player , reading lights and eye glass tracker provide butler type capabilities that enable the system to appeal to markets beyond the elderly and infirmed . the system may also include an x10 transmitter / receiver to automatically control various household lights and appliances . equipping the system with a robot arm enables the robot to fetch items , turn on and off wall switches and open the refrigerator ."
"fig1 a illustrates a prior art system on chip ( soc ) architecture 101. the soc defines a processor 102 that is coupled to an off chip memory controller 104. the off chip memory controller is coupled via an external data bus 105 to a memory subsystem 106 in the form of a dynamic random access memory ( dram ). the memory subsystem 106 is comprised of n memory pages 106 a to 106 n, where each of the n pages is individually addressable. a cache buffer 108 is also provided for storing cache lines transferred from the memory subsystem prior to having them stored within a cache memory 107 provided as part of the soc 101. the off chip memory controller 104 is used to access any of the memory pages 106 a to 106 n to provide data bytes from the memory subsystem using the external data bus 105 to the cache memory 107 and cache buffer 108. typically, an amount of data bytes transferred between the memory subsystem 106 and the cache memory 107 or cache buffer 108 is an amount of data bytes forming a cache line 109. the off chip memory controller 104 is controlled by the processor 102 and is responsible for executing pre - fetch transactions from the memory subsystem 106 to cache memory 107 and cache buffer 108 in order to reduce processor stall cycles. when the processor 102 generates a pre - fetch transaction, a constant latency and a variable latency may result. the constant latency has is a constant amount of time, in that a same amount of time is required to set up every pre - fetch transaction. the variable latency scales in time in dependence upon an amount of data elements that are to be pre - fetched during the transaction. therefore the variable latency time is multiplied by a number of data elements transferred in the pre - fetch operation and added to the constant latency to result in a total pre - fetch latency. when a pre - fetch transaction takes place the external data bus 105 is dedicated to the current pre - fetch transaction and as a result other transactions cannot share the same external bus 105 resource at the same time until the pre - fetch is completed. the time taken for completion of a pre - fetch transaction is dependent upon a number of data bytes transferred in the transaction. thus, in some cases it is more advantageous to perform pre - fetch transactions having smaller cache line size, such that the external bus resource is less utilized for each transaction. however, by generating a larger number of pre - fetch transactions more time is spent in setting up each transaction and hence an amount of time attributed to the constant latency increases. therefore, there is a tradeoff between a number of pre - fetch transactions and an amount of data transferred in each pre - fetch transaction. additional difficulties arise when the memory subsystem is accessed, since there is an additional latency incurred by accessing of memory pages within the memory subsystem 106. when a memory page within the memory subsystem 106 is accessed, subsequent access to that same memory page is not possible because a memory circuitry used for storing that page is typically single ported and therefore does not support multiple reads at different addresses. if a pre - fetch transaction is already being performed for accessing a current memory page at a first address then execution of a subsequent transaction that accesses the same memory page at a second address is delayed until the prior transaction has been completed. this poses a problem for next sequential cache line pre - fetching since typically the next sequential cache line is located in the same memory page as the previously fetched cache line. however, the process of pre - fetching the next sequential cache line incurs a delay prior to commencement because the next sequential cache line pre - fetch transaction has to wait until the previous cache line fetch transaction has completed. once the fetch operation has completed then the memory page is available for access and the next sequential cache line pre - fetch transaction commences. typically, during the waiting time for the transaction to complete, the processor experiences stall cycles, thus resulting in less efficient instruction processing by the processor 102. not to mention that while the external data bus resource is being utilized for pre - fetch operations interference may result from other memory subsystem transactions attempting to use the same bus resource. of course, internal data busses coupling the processor, the cache memory, and the off chip memory controller are also utilized during pre - fetch operations and hence fetching of the next sequential cache line may result in interference from memory subsystem transaction originating from other soc elements. thus, a large transaction latency is typically observed because of closed off - chip memory pages within the memory subsystem 106. the above problems are compounded significantly in multi processor systems. fig1 b illustrates a multi - processor system on chip ( soc ) architecture 111. the architecture within the soc is similar to that shown in fig1 a. however, in this case an additional processor 112 has been added. both of the processors 102 and 112 are coupled to the off chip memory controller 104 and share the external data bus 105 when retrieving of data elements from the memory subsystem 106. thus during some situations the off chip memory controller 104 is accessing the memory subsystem to fulfill a pre - fetch transaction for the processor 102. during these same situations the additional processor 112 has no immediate access to the memory subsystem because the external bus 105 is being utilized. if the additional processor 112 is waiting to initiate a pre - fetch operation the additional processor 112 incurs stall cycles during this time in order to wait for the pre - fetch operation for the processor 102 to complete. therefore, adding the additional processor to the soc does not necessarily increase the processing capacity of the system. having each processor nearly constantly waiting for the other processor & # 39 ; s pre - fetch operation to be completed reduces the performance of the dual processor system to that of a single processor system or even worse. thus, unless benefits of adding the additional processor facilitate increased processing bandwidth, multiprocessor systems are non - advantageous. in fact performance decreases when the two processors are competing with one another for the same external bus 105 resource. fig1 c illustrates another embodiment of a multi - processor system on chip ( soc ) architecture 121. the architecture within the soc is similar to that shown in fig1 b. however, in this case the additional processor 112 is replaced by a specialty processor 122. operation of the soc is nearly identical to that of fig1 b. that said, because each of the processors is different and is for providing performance for different applications, such a system will likely still experience a performance improvement even when stall cycles are abundant. of course, a reduction in stall cycles will result in an improvement in performance of any of the above described systems. herein, a next - sequential line pre - fetch technique is described that exploits characteristics of the soc interface to the memory subsystem. rather than generating a single cache line pre - fetch from the memory subsystem for each occurrence of a cache miss, a single transaction is generated that fetches both the cache line for which the miss occurred and the next sequential cache line. the result is a single memory subsystem pre - fetch transaction that has a double transaction size when compared to a transaction size when only a single cache line is pre - fetched from the memory subsystem ; of course the constant latency remains the same. therefore, a pre - fetch transaction of a single 2 n - element request is generated rather than an n - element request followed by a subsequent n - element request when the first n - elements fail to resolve the cache miss, with n being an amount of elements in a cache line. this type of pre - fetch operation thus reduces bursty bus utilization. the variable latency being the same in both cases when 2 n elements are retrieved, since the same number of data bytes are transferred in the pre - fetch operation. of course, 2 n, 3 n, 4 n, etc element request pre - fetch transactions are possible depending on which is most efficient in terms of decreasing stall cycles and bursty bus utilization. fig2 a illustrates a system on chip architecture ( soc ) 201. the soc defines a processor 202 that is coupled to an internal data bus and to an off chip memory controller 204. the off chip memory controller is coupled via an external data bus 205 to a memory subsystem 206 in the form of a dynamic random access memory ( dram ), or a first memory 206. the memory subsystem 206 is comprised of n memory pages 206 a to 206 n, where each of the n pages is individually addressable. a cache buffer 208 is also provided for a single cache line transferred from the memory subsystem and for storing a multiple cache line transferred from the memory subsystem prior to having them stored within a cache memory 207 provided as part of the soc 201. the off chip memory controller 204 is used to access any of the memory pages 206 a to 206 n to provide data bytes from the memory subsystem using the external data bus 205 to the cache memory 207 and cache buffer 208. typically, an amount of data bytes transferred between the memory subsystem and the cache memory 207 or cache buffer 208 is an amount of data bytes forming a cache line ; however, during a cache miss situation, an amount of data bytes forming multiple cache lines are transferred. the off chip memory controller 204 is controlled by the processor 202 and is responsible for executing pre - fetch transactions from the memory subsystem 206 to cache memory 207 and cache buffer 208 in order to reduce processor stall cycles. the off chip memory controller 204 includes circuitry therein for performing a single cache line 209 a transfer operations and for performing multiple cache line transfer operations. for example, the multiple cache line transfer operation transfers two sequential cache lines 209 a and 209 b during a cache miss situation. fig2 b illustrates a multi - processor system on chip ( soc ) architecture 211. the architecture within the soc is similar to that shown in fig2 a. however, in this case an additional processor 212 has been added. both of the processors 202 and 212 are coupled to the off chip memory controller 204 and share the external data bus 205 when retrieving of data elements from the memory subsystem 206. thus during some situations the off chip memory controller 204 is accessing the memory subsystem to fulfill a pre - fetch transaction for the processor 202. during these same situations the additional processor 212 has no immediate access to the memory subsystem because the external bus 205 is being utilized fig2 c illustrates another embodiment of a multi - processor system on chip ( soc ) architecture 221. the architecture within the soc is similar to that shown in fig2 b. however, in this case a specialty processor 222 replaces the additional processor 212. operation of the soc is nearly identical to that of fig2 b. in accordance with fig2 d, a flowchart is shown indicative of whether the processor operates in a first mode 290 of operation or a second mode 291 of operation for transferring of data in the pre - fetch transaction. in the first mode of operation 290 the processor transfers data from the first memory to the cache memory n data elements at a time, and in the second mode of operation 291 the processor transfers data from the first memory to the cache memory m n data elements at a time wherein m is an integer greater than 1. in accordance with fig3 a, a memory subsystem memory page 206 a having five sequential cache lines 301 through 305 stored therein is shown. each of these cache lines has 4 data elements, 301 a to 301 d through 305 a to 305 d, respectively. the 5 * 4 data elements are located at starting addresses 0 00, through 0 10. if the addresses of the data elements are represented generally by a n then a next sequential line to an nth element is found using a n + 1 = a n + ( 4 * element size ). when transferring of cache lines from the memory subsystem to circuit elements within the soc, memory system, protocols are used. with respect to these protocols there are typically three aspects that are observed. firstly, memory subsystem protocols typically support transaction sizes that are an integer power of 2 of the transaction element size. namely they operate using transaction sizes that are powers of 2, i. e. 2 n. as a result, two, four and eight element data transfers are common for memory subsystem transactions. secondly, the memory subsystem transaction memory region is usually a region that is aligned according to the transaction size. so a four element transaction refers to a region in which the first element is four element aligned, as shown in fig3 a where a n mod ( element size ) = 0. having aligned cache lines in the memory subsystem facilitates reading of these cache lines from the memory subsystem. though the cache lines of fig3 a each have 4 elements thus a n mod 4 = 0 eight element cache lines are also easily supported. a memory having eight element cache lines is shown in fig3 b. in accordance with fig3 b, a memory subsystem memory page 106 a having five sequential cache lines 311 through 315 stored therein is shown. each of these cache lines has 8 data elements, 311 a to 311 h through 315 a to 315 h, respectively. the 5 * 8 data elements are located at starting addresses 0 00, through 0 20. if the addresses of the data elements are represented generally by a n then a next sequential line to an nth element is found using a n + 1 = a n + ( 8 * element size ). furthermore, most memory subsystem protocols support linear address wrap around within a transaction. therefore, if a cache line is accessed using other than a four element aligned boundary, the four data elements are still transferred, however not in sequential data element ascending address order. if for instance a cache miss occurs for element 301 b, then the pre - fetch transaction begins with the address for element 301 b thus transferring the data elements in the following order : 301 b, 301 c, 301 d, 301 a from the memory subsystem. four elements are transferred since this is the cache line size used in this example and the memory subsystem is four element line aligned. as soon as the element that caused the cache miss and within the cache line at address 0x00, element 301 b, is provided to the processor from the memory subsystem, the processor commences unstalled operation. of course, to free up a refill unit of a processor for future use the entire four element cache line is transferred from the memory subsystem. though, it appears that a difference between a memory subsystem architecture of fig3 a and fig3 b is merely a design choice, it has now been found that supporting both architectures, each for a different operating mode of the processor, provides benefits to performance of the overall system. a explanation is provided below with reference to the memory diagram of fig4. in fig4, a four data element aligned memory architecture is shown with heavier lines separating 8 data element aligned data elements. when a cache hit situation occurs, the cache is operated in a similar fashion to prior art caches wherein a cache line is transferred within a single memory access operation as the processor operates in the first mode 290. when a cache miss occurs two cache lines are transferred within a single memory access operation as the processor operates in the second mode 291. preferably, the two cache lines are 8 element aligned. thus, when a cache miss occurs for data element 401 a, cache lines 401 are retrieved. however, when a cache miss occurs for element 402 e, a single cache line is transferred in a first cache miss data transfer operation ; thereafter, two cache lines 401 are retrieved if the cache miss situation persists. alternatively, two cache lines 402 are retrieved ; this is less advantageous as it increases the bus utilization for little possible gain. when a cache miss occurs for element 403 a, transferring two cache lines 403 increases a likelihood that sufficient data is stored within the cache to resolve the cache miss and to reduce a likelihood of a subsequent cache miss. this likelihood is present because data element 403 a is near the end of its cache line. another embodiment of the invention is disclosed, again with reference to the memory diagram of fig4. during a cache miss, a pre - fetching transaction for pre - fetching multiple cache lines in the form of two cache lines 402 each having four data elements is performed when the following two conditions are met : the element that caused the cache miss in a cache line is the first element 402 a in that cache line ; and the element that caused the cache miss 402 a in a cache line is both four data elements aligned and eight data elements aligned. when the above two conditions are met a double sized pre - fetch transaction is performed, thereby transferring the eight data elements 402 using the second mode of operation. this advantageously allows the processor to operate unstalled as soon as the first element 402 a that caused the cache miss is provided to the processor. furthermore, all data elements of the first cache line are received by the processor prior to having any data elements of the next line, or pre - fetched line, presented to the processor. this therefore allows the processor & # 39 ; s refill unit to be freed as soon as the first four elements of the 8 - element transaction are provided to the processor. when a data element within a cache line but other than a first data element causes a cache miss, because of the linear address wrap around, transferring of two sequential cache lines is avoided in the present embodiment. as such, elements from the next sequential cache line are not transferred as the processor operates in the first mode of operation. advantageously, the performance of the pre - fetching technique in accordance with the embodiment operates efficiently when instruction cache references have a highly regular, sequential access pattern. since, when a reference to a certain cache line occurs in the memory subsystem, it is highly likely that the sequential cache line is referred to in the near future. therefore, by providing both cache lines, current and sequential, to the processor, processor stall cycles are reduced as well as total constant latencies associated with the pre - fetch transactions. data cache references for streaming / sequential access patterns benefit from sequential pre - fetching. these access patterns usually miss a cache line on its first element. advantageously, the process of pre - fetching the current and next sequential cache lines in accordance with the embodiment of the invention is beneficial for streaming / sequential access patterns when the first element within the cache line for which the miss occurred is eight elements aligned. of course, when the first element within the cache line for which the miss occurred is other than eight elements aligned, there is no performance hit on the system since it defaults to the normal cache pre - fetch operation of the system. though the invention is described with single and double cache line sizes, it may be applied with other multiple cache line sizes. preferably, the multiple cache line size is a power of 2. further preferably, a number data elements within a cache line is a power of two. numerous other embodiments may be envisaged without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.","memory pages within a memory subsystem are typically accessed using an off chip memory controller coupled to an external bus . data elements , in the form of a cache line , propagate along the external bus to the processor . cache line pre - fetching provides a cache line from the memory subsystem to fulfill the processor request . unfortunately , when the memory subsystem is being accessed by a fetch operation , a subsequent fetch request cannot access the memory subsystem until the previous transaction has completed . thus subsequent transactions must wait until the previous transaction is completed . this waiting typically results in processor stall cycles , where the processor is stalled in waiting for the memory subsystem to become available . this is especially evident in multi - processor systems , where the addition of another processor does not cause the processing bandwidth to increase substantially . especially when the processors are waiting for each other &# 39 ; s memory subsystem transactions to complete . it would be more advantageous to provide a fetch operation that has a variable fetch size that would allow each of the processor to incur less stall cycles , thus increasing processing bandwidth ."
"referring to fig7 through 11, a basic embodiment of the present invention will be described hereunder. in fig7 a basic construction of a tremolo effect producing system of the present invention is indicated in a section as viewed from the side to better understand the present invention, which comprises an acoustically sealed, closed housing 10 of an elongated shape and an electric motor 15 mounted outside thereof. the housing 10 includes therein a loudspeaker 11 positioned on the left side thereof and a microphone 12 on the right side, or for example, on the inner side wall of the housing 10. the sound radiating surface of the loudspeaker 11 and the sound pickup surface of the microphone 12 are arranged opposite to each other. a rotating cylindrical member 13 mounted on a rotatable shaft 14 is disposed between the loudspeaker 11 and the microphone 12. the cylindrical member 13 comprises symmetrically arranged opposite side walls 13a and 13b each forming an arc of a circle having a center at the shaft 14, and upper and lower walls 13c and 13c, respectively, fixed to the uppermost and lowermost ends of the side walls 13a and 13b as best seen in fig8 a and 8b. the side walls 13a and 13b are formed not to constitute an entire circle, leaving openings 13e and 13f therebetween, as shown in fig8 a. these openings 13e and 13f are disposed at diametrically opposite points of said circle and are intercommunicated with each other through an open space 13g defined by the side walls 13a and 13b and upper and lower walls 13 c and 13b. thus, a sound passage 13a is formed in the cylindrical member 13 to pass sound therethrough. the shaft 14 is operatively connected with the driving shaft of the motor 15, so that the rotating member 13 also can be rotated by the motor at a speed of 0. 5 to 15 revolutions per second. the rotational speed of the rotating member 13 can be easily controlled by electrically adjusting the drive motor. the appearance of the above - constructed system of the present invention is shown in general in fig9. the abovementioned rotating member 13 may be made of material such as a synthetic resin in the form of a cylindrical body and may have a cross section having various shapes of through - holes, as indicated in fig8 a and 8b as well as in fig1 a through 10d. that is, fig1 a to 10d illustrate, in transverse section different forms of an opening or openings constituting a sound passage or sound passages 13a provided in a solid cylindrical body constituting the rotating member 13, respectively. the shape of the opening or openings is preferably symmetrical with respect to the rotating axis of the member 13 or the shaft 14. in the operation of the abovementioned system of the present invention, when a low frequency current of a tone signal which is developed from, for example, an audio output terminal of an electronic musical instrument is supplied to the loudspeaker 11 accommodated in the housing 10 and when simultaneously therewith the rotating member 13 is rotated at a speed, preferably between 0. 5 and 15 revolutions per second, the sound from the loudspeaker 11 is periodically transmitted through a sound passage or passage 13a of the member 13 provided on the side of the microphone 12 and is modulated with a tremolo effect in accordance with the rotational speed of the rotating member 13, and the thus modulated sound is picked up by the microphone, whereby an audio signal having a tremolo effect is obtained at the microphone 12. the output signal of the microphone 12 is fed to a power amplifier of the electronic musical instrument as will be described hereinafter and is mixed with the aforesaid tone signal thereat and is reproduced by a loudspeaker of the instrument or a headphone, and thus, a reproduced sound wave will provide a tremolo effect as desired. as will be appreciated from the above description, in the system of the present invention, a listener does not hear the sound from the loudspeaker 11 directly, but the sound is used to be acoustically modulated or processed and translated into an electrical signal having a required waveform to generate a tremolo effect. accordingly, the loudspeaker 11 as a sound radiating means as well as the housing for accommodating it can have a substantially reduced size. referring to fig1, there is shown a schematic circuit block diagram of an electronic musical instrument to which the system according to the present invention is applied, only by way of example. in the circuit construction, tone signals generated by known tone generators o are suitably keyed by a keying system k including a keyboard to select a required tone signal. the selected tone signal of a low frequency is passed through a tone coloring circuit f and applied, through two change - over switches s 1 and s 2 connected in parallel with an output terminal of the tone coloring circuit f, to a main amplifier a 1 and a sub - amplifier a 2 alternately. an output signal from the main amplifier a 1 is fed to a fixed loudspeaker sp which is usually called non - tremolo speaker, while an output signal delivered from the sub - amplifier a 2 is fed to the loudspeaker 11 accommodated in the closed housing 10. sound reproduced by the loudspeaker 11 is modulated through a rotating sound interrupting member 13 and is picked up by the microphone 12 and is converted thereat to an electrical signal. such an output signal of the microphone 12 is applied via a level adjusting circuit r such as a potentiometer, to the main amplifier a 1 and is mixed thereat with the output signal provided from the tone coloring circuit f. thus, a tone signal of a relatively low frequency band developed at the tone coloring circuit f is supplied via the change - over switch s 1 to the main amplifier a 1 as it is, and is reproduced by the loudspeaker sp, with the resulting sound wave not containing any tremolo effect. on the other hand, a tone signal of a relativly high frequency band delivered from the tone coloring f is fed, through the change - over switch s 2, to the sub - amplifier a 2 and is reproduced by the loudspeaker 11 of the tremolo effect producing system, and then the sound from the loudspeaker 11 is subjected to a tremolo effect by means of the sound interrupting member 13 being rotated and is translated by the microphone 12 into a tone signal with a tremolo effect. the thus obtained tone signal is applied, via the level adjusting circuit r, to the main amplifier a 1 and is reproduced by the fixed loudspeaker sp of the instrument substantially at the same time with the reproduction of the non - tremolo tone signal. thus, the electronic musical instrument including the system according to the present invention can easily give a person who is listening to the music being played by the instrument a natural and pleasant feeling because of the thus produced tremolo effect. referring to fig1, 13a and 13b, another embodiment of the present invention which is modified from that of fig7 will be described hereunder. the housing 10 of fig1 comprises therein a rotational disc plate 16 having cotouts 16a as shown in fig1 a or an opening or through - hole 16b, as shown in fig1 b, disposed between the loudspeaker 11 and the microphone 12. the disc plate 16 is rotatably supported by supports 17 through a shaft connected with the disc plate, and is operatively connected through a pulley 19 and a drive belt 18 with the motor 15 adapted to be driven by the motor at a speed similar to that of the abovementioned rotational member 13. the disc plate 16 is so disposed as to be rotated in a plane perpendicular to an axis along which the loudspeaker 11 and the microphone 12 face each other. in the housing of the abovementioned construction, the sound coming from the loudspeaker is subjected to a tremolo effect as the disc plate 16 is rotated at the abovementioned speed to periodically pass the sound from the speaker through the cutouts or opening, and the sound thus passed therethrough is picked up and translated by the microphone 12 into an audio signal with a tremolo effect. the signal may be processed and reproduced in a similar manner as described in the proceeding embodiment when used in an electronic musical instrument. in the embodiments of fig7 and 12, the loudspeaker 11 may be movably mounted so as to thereby produce much complicated and much interesting tremolo effect. for example, by rotating the loudspeaker, a doppler effect is added to that effect given by the rotation of the disc plate. referring to fig1 to 16, there are shown partial modifications of the constructions of fig7 and 12, respectively, in which a plurality of separate pickup means such as microphones 12a, 12b and 12c are provided in the housing 10 in different positions on the side opposite to the loudspeaker 11. both the modified systems shown in fig1 and 16 have basically similar constructions and function as described previously except for the provision of plural microphones. the microphones 12a, 12b and 12c pick up, independently of each other, the sound delivered from the loudspeaker 11 which is modulated with complicated tremolo effects as the rotational member 13 or 16 is rotated, thus developing individual audio signals capable of producing different tremolo effects at their outputs. fig1 illustrates a schematic circuit block diagram representing a modification of fig1 in which the system of fig1 or 16 may be used. the modification, as shown in fig1, comprises separate microphones 12a, 12b and 12c accommodated in the housing 10 in different positions, and level adjusting circuits such as potentiometers ra, rb and rc connected with the separate microphones at one end of each of the potentiometers respectively. the other end of each potentiometer is connected to an input terminal of the power amplifier a 1, so that audio signals having different waveforms and levels fed through the potentiometers ra, rb and rc from the separate microphones may be mixed at the amplifier a 1. thus, since each microphone can pick up an input sound wave which is different in phase, amplitude and reflection, an output signal of the amplifier a 1 developed by mixing the thus obtained auido signals having different properties will cause sounds to be reproduced which have natural, delicate tremolo effects by means of the non - tremolo loudspeaker sp. referring to fig1 and 19, there are illustrated still other embodiments of the present invention, which generally employ in the closed housing a plurality of rotational sound shielding members having through - holes or cutouts therein as previously shown in fig7 or 12. in fig1, reference numeral 10 indicates an elongated acoustically sealed box or housing. in the enclosed space of the housing 10 is disposed a loudspeaker 11 on the side of one end of the housing along the length thereof and a microphone 12 is positioned on the side of the other end. in the space of the housing located between the loudspeaker 11 and the microphone 12, a rotational member 131 having a sectional structure including a cylindrical shape with a sound passage 13a in cross section, as shown in fig8 a and 8b for example, is provided so as to shield the sound generated by the loudspeaker 11 excluding the sound passage 13 a. the rotational member 131 is pivotably mounted on a shaft 14 which is rotated by a motor 15a. the shaft 14 is mounted on the housing 10 perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the housing 10. between the member 131 and the microphone 12 another rotational member 132 having a similar structure as the member 131 is disposed with its rotating axis extending in a direction normal to that of the shaft 14 and is driven by another motor 15b. both the rotational members 131 and 132 are rotated at the same or different speeds of 0. 5 to 15 revolutions per second, separately, so that the sound fed from the loudspeaker 11 can be subjected to complicated wave modulations or complicated tremolo effects and then to be picked up and translated into an audio signal having properties corresponding to the modulated sound wave by the microphone 12. fig1 shows a modification of fig1 in which the mechanism of the sound shielding member 131 is replaced by a rotational disc plate 16, supports 17, a pulley 19 and a belt 18 as shown in fig1. an application of the system as shown in fig1 for an electronic musical instrument is illustrated in fig1 only by way of example. the construction is principally similar to that of fig1. referring now to fig2 and 23, further modifications of the present invention providing more sophisticated tremolo effects are indicated in side section, in which a closed housing 10 accommodates a plurality of acoustic transducers such as loudspeakers 11, 11 & # 39 ; and 11 & # 34 ; with a distance spaced from each other, a sound pickup such as a microphone 12 positioned oppositely therebetween and a plurality of rotational sound shielding members 13, 13 & # 39 ; and 13 & # 34 ; having through - holes or cutouts for passing sounds and disposed between each loudspeaker and the microphone. the members 13, 13 & # 39 ; and 13 & # 34 ; are pivotably mounted on shafts 14, 14 & # 39 ; and 14 & # 34 ; and are rotated by motors 15, 15 & # 39 ; and 15 & # 34 ; at required speeds between 0. 5 and 15 revolutions per second, respectively. the revolution ratio of these motors is preferably set so as not to be an integer. in a similar way as described previously, a low frequency input signal is applied to the respective loudspeakers enclosed in the housing 10 and the subjected to individual modulations through the respective members 13, 13 + and 13 & # 34 ; and received by the single microphone 12, thus resulting in an acousto - electrically converted signal at the output of the microphone, which signal is capable of producing desired tremolo effect through the sound reproducing means. in fig2, two pairs of loudspeakers 11, 11 & # 39 ; and sound modulating members 13, 13 & # 39 ; are aligned opposite to each other, while three such pairs are arranged about the single microphone in a y - like form in fig2. more than three such pairs may be provided with respect to the single microphone if any more complicated tremolo effect is required to be obtained. fig2 shows a block diagram of an example of an electronic musical instrument to which the modified system shown in fig2 is applied. the details of this example are omitted here because of the substantial similarity to fig1. fig2 illustrates another modification of the present invention in which, as will be understood from the foregoing statement, the systems shown in fig7 and 12 are combined excepting the single microphone so that they may be opposed to each other about the single microphone.","a tremolo effect producing system comprises at least one electro - acoustic transducer such as a loudspeaker for converting an electrical audio signal to a sound , at least one acousto - electrical transducer such as a microphone for converting sound to an electrical signal and disposed so as to face the loudspeaker , and at least one sound shielding member rotatably mounted between the above - mentioned two transducers and having sound transmitting openings or cutouts whereby sounds from the speaker will be periodically and / or individually interrupted with fade - in and fade - out effects as said member is rotated . these transducers and sound shielding member are sealed in a closed housing . thereby the sound wave emitted from the speaker through the openings or cutouts of the rotating member is converted to an electrical signal with natural tremolo effects by the microphone . the thus - produced signal may be mixed with an audio signal with non - tremolo effect and amplified and reproduced by a loudspeaker ."

"in accordance with the subject invention, fig1 shows a general embodiment of system 200, fig2 shows an alternative embodiment as system 2, and fig5 a shows the preferred embodiment of system 200 with components and data flow. for complete comprehension of fig1, 2 and 5 a, certain terms, phrases and expressions employed are defined as follows : each commercial transaction comprises, by definition, an offer, acceptance and executes or closes for a determined amount of consideration ( in dollars and cents ), and thus has a value ( plus or minus, as in credit or debit ), an amount in units of fractional currency ( i. e., dollars and cents ) comprising purchase price minus coupons other sales deductions, plus tax, ( as the specific case may be ), and a transaction - indicative element identifying the transaction as, e. g., goods ( and the specific type or code number ) and quantity ). accordingly, system 200 generates, records, retrieves, maintains and transfers ( at different stages ) system data, comprising at least three types per portable device : ( 1 ) cre - bit - type data generated per transaction and representing the value and amount of that transaction ; ( 2 ) account balance - type data representing the net sum of all cre - bit data generated for all commercial transactions on that device ; and ( 3 ) transactional - type data generated per transaction representing the transaction - indicative element. additionally, the commercial transactions comprise at least two : one a credit - type transaction preferably executing with a quantity of physical, fractional currency, and the other a debit - type transaction executing without physical fractional currency. observably, the credit - type transaction can execute with a check, credit or other modality, but the preferred credit - type transaction herein involves physical fractional currency ( i. e., paper and coinage ), and more preferably physical fractional metallic currency ( i. e., coinage ). returning to fig1, merchant ( hosting the system ), acting as a sponsoring company, offers svc - type portable device ( s ) at step 202 to one or more consumer ( s ). the merchant, in this scenario is considered a sponsoring company as that term has been defined by the federal reserve as it is operating as a virtual bank, providing to the consumer the device at step 202 which operates in accordance with the inventive to provide the full gamut of commercial transactions services, earmarked in fig1. in particular, the merchant is interfaced with a bank 4, at which the merchant maintains a demand deposit account 4 a, with a balance that is positively effected by initial transactions, loads and reloads. in consideration of the recognition by the federal reserve that merchants may be sponsoring companies it is within the purview of the subject invention to provide an interface between portable devices and individual accounts per device with a bank 4 as an option, and not a requirement. should the option be invoked, then the fractional - reserve banking component of the instant invention is also enhanced as detailed in prior filings and issued patent, incorporated by reference, hereinabove. however, in accordance with the preferred embodiment, the merchant does select to interface portable devices with specific bank - maintained accounts, and thus the merchant remains a sponsoring company not subject to regulation d but compliant with regulation e s requirement of consumer disclosure, providing to the consumer commercial transactions and services, which may be part or all of those shown in fig1, which, in the preferred embodiment ( see, e. g., fig5 a ) comprise general spending and purchases for goods or services, intra - merchant, as shown by box 212, in fig1. optionally, but not preferentially, other services to the consumer include : government benefits ( like government checks or payments ) via step 214, check cashing and / or writing via step 216, child support payments or receipts via step 218, credit functions via step 220, savings abilities via step 222, insurance abilities via step 224, atm, money transfers and / or travelers & # 39 ; checks via step 225, employee related benefits ( like payroll and employee payments, loan receipts and all other payroll card functions ) via step 226, and any other category of banking - related services via miscellaneous provision at step 228. at step 204, customer procures the portable device as an initial transaction with a quantity of physical fractional currency, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the subject invention. thereupon, cre - bit - type data is generated and transferred to the bank for for increasing the balance of the bank account at step 302 a, complete system data is transferred to merchant - based virtual account ( which records and maintains all transactions ) 207, which in turn transfers that system data to the portable device to enable it to provide statement, equivalents, transactions, histories and balances at step 208. thereupon merchant and customer perform additional commercial transactions at step 206, permitted as long as balance - type data is & gt ; 0 ( meaning the balance is larger than the transaction ) determined at step 210, and system data for each transaction is transferred at step 302 back to the device at 208. as a reloadable svc - type device and system, load / reload option is provided at step 209 to add further funds to the balance, and when that commercial transaction occurs, full system data is sent via step 302 to virtual account means 207, and as well cre - bit - type data only is sent via step 302 a to the bank for deposit in the demand deposit account 4 a. in this manner, observably, the demand deposit account balance increases and does not decrease for each subsequent commercial transaction, while the virtual account logs and tracks all transactions. in accordance with the subject invention, fig2 shows an alternative embodiment of system as item 2, wherein banking institution 4, has demand deposit account ( 1 ) ( which correlates with 4 a in fig1 ), and optionally has demand deposit account ( 2 ), which is specific to the portable device 8. in this manner, certain transactions are logged by each of two captive accounts, via transmissions 7, with a virtual account 207 maintaining full records for commercial transactions 502. indeed, despite the fact that transactions occur between two accounts, where the two accounts are with the same merchant and / or bank, the underlying currency merely moves from one location to another, but remains intra - bank 4 ( or intra - merchant, as the case may be ). in this manner, the actual asset base of the bank remains unchanged, while the currency moves between accounts. thus, the fractional - reserve banking remains unchanged, despite the differences between account balances, as the asset base of the bank is not depleted with such transactions, thereby achieving a hereinbefore indicated objective and feature of the invention set forth. it should be appreciated, however, in fig2, that should demand deposit account ( 2 ) not be provided, then the system as shown will be the same as the preferred embodiment of the subject invention, as shown in further detail in fig5 a. in this regard, portable device 8 accommodates the preferred svc - styled modality, with amounts ( like a gift card or stored value card ) but otherwise significantly improved and dissimilar for all the reasons evident and discussed. once acquired, it is used with one or more of node devices 10. communication between node device 10 and banking institution 4 is determined based upon an encrypted interface 1 ( item 20 ), and can be achieved through the internet, telephone system, intranet or any other suitable means known to one of skill in the art. as with encrypted interface 1 ( 20 ), node device 10 communicates with portable device 8 through encrypted interface 2 ( item 22 ). it should be appreciated that portable device 8 communicates in close proximity, utilizing a limited power output, to node device 10. with a limited dispersive angle transceiver mechanism in portable device 8 and low power output, limited power is used, and the device 8 must be proximate to the receiver for communications to occur, thereby enhancing privacy. as indicated, bluetooth is a preferred encryption and communication modality, although other such modalities may be used provided the specifications are compatible with the underlying letter and spirit of the claimed invention. node device 10 takes the form of a multiplicity of transactional devices, preferably a pos device. clearly, each person has a portable device 8 and an associated account with the merchant and optionally but not preferrably banking institution 4 to enable a multiplicity of transactions to occur via node device 10, without depleting the asset base of banking institution 4 ( when optionally secured ) while permitting commercial transactions. fig3 shows a component design for portable device 8, in accordance with a preferred embodiment thereof. in particular, processor 26 is provided with digital input / output ( i / o ) support 26 a for interfacing with optional security interface 30 ( like a biometric or other device ), wireless communication interface 40 ( for bluetooth, for example ), power management 38 for controlling power usage and supply, battery 36 and optional wired communication interface 42 ( like an ieee 1394, usb, or the like ). on the other hand, processor 26 also engages display 28 for interfacing with the user, operator interface 29 ( like a wheel, pushbuttons, keypad, and the like ) and memory 32. in this manner portable device 8 is rendered fully operational. it should be appreciated that display 28 is an on demand feature of portable device 8, permitting the customer, through the operator interface 29, to not only immediately know the account balance, but to see the list of transactions that have occurred. in this manner, the heretofore long felt need of the federal reserve to provide transactional information to the consumer and merchant ( a / k / a sponsoring company ) with or without the bank, is resolved. fig4 shows a component design for node device 10, having similarly named components to that shown in fig3. it should be appreciated that while the selection of individual components for portable device 8 require consideration of power consumption in order to enable a more efficient use of battery 36, in node device 10, it is assumed that power supply 36 a is employed which can be wired to a 110v wall current hence rendering power consumption of less concern. in fig4, there is shown processor 26 b, digital i / o support 26 c, power management 38 a, wired communication interface with bank 42 a, and portable device interface 44, which, function in accordance with the indicated naming. likewise, processor 26 b engages display 28 a for interface with the operator via operator interface 29 a which can be a keyboard, and memory 32 a. it should be appreciated that memory in portable device 8 as well as node device 10 renders the account and transactional information concomitant with that stored in banking institution 4 ( fig2 ). fig5 shows a flow chart ( schemata ) for the protocol of portable device 8 to node device 10. the flow commences with power - save mode 46 ( and ends at the same point ). if radio frequency activation occurs ( as in automatic, close proximity to node device 10, thereby automatically engaging ), power on occurs at step 50. likewise, if button activation is selected at step 52 for portable device 8, power on occurs at step 50, and validation of biometric information occurs at step 52. it should be appreciated that other forms of validation can be employed, including entry of a code. in either respect, once power is on, the network is established to receive discovery packets at step 51. thereupon packets are sent at step 54, reply packets are awaited at step 56, received at step 58, and protocol start messages are sent at step 60. server information and public keys are thereupon received at step 62, with a reception of encryption start packet at step 64, and reception of transaction information in encrypted form at step 66. client encryption keys are engaged at step 68, encryption package sent started at step 72, and a waiting for button step occurs at step 79. at this point, validation occurs at step 74 ( if not theretofore ), account information, user identification and data, in encrypted form, are sent at step 76, reply is awaited at step 78, transaction acknowledgment received at step 80, display is updated with the transaction results at step 82, and led is lit at 84 indicating a completed transaction at step 84, the network is closed at step 86, and the device return to power - save mode at step 46. fig5 a shows system 200 in its preferred embodiment, comprising portable device 8, node device 10, communications means 22 therebetween for transferring system data 302, and virtual account means 207, all located within the merchant venue. portable device 8 comprises components 46, power save mode, which interfaces with validation 52 ( biometric or other ), and if validated, prompts the user to choose a function at 70 a, which includes displaying data at 82, or transacting commercial transactions which feeds data to communication means 22. node device 10 includes pos 16 and cash drawer 16 a. pos 16 is used for commercial transactions 502, including purchase / reload which is the sole transaction that uses physical fractional currency, and hence places the same in cash drawer 16 a, triggers cre - bit - type system data 302 a to be transmitted via wire 7 to federal reserve bank 4, wherein merchant & # 39 ; s demand deposit account 4 a, and wherein the balance is increased in accordance with said data 302 a. each time a commercial transaction occurs in system 200 as shown in fig5 a, node device 10 engages merchant network 20 to transfer all system data 302 to virtual account 207, for recordation as in t1, t2, t3, and t4 ( by example ). as indicated, system data 302 comprises cre - bit - type 302 a, account balance - type 302 b and transactional type - 302 c. fig6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 show exploded perspective views of portable device 8 with the components laid thereupon, conforming with the numbers indicated above. in this preferred embodiment, 26 is a processor with memory, 40 a bluetooth chip, 38 a power management chip, 26 a a digital i / o chip, 28 a display ( in this instance lcd ), with optional biometric interface to 34 a a button ( mouse - type ), 34 c an led, 42 a usb interface, 34 b a thumbwheel, 36 a power inlet for charging the battery, 36 b a battery connector, and 36 a battery. while there have been shown, described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated and in its operation may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. it is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.","a system incorporating method and associated apparatus for establishing virtual banking in a merchant venue or syndication of merchants for one or more consumers in a manner that increases the deposit -

"fig1 and fig2 depict apparatus and method representing the conventional testing apparatus and method for testing vertical piles, as shown on astm d1143 - 81 ( reapproved 1987 ). fig1 depicts the conventional testing apparatus and method for testing a single pile. fig2 depicts the conventional testing apparatus and method for testing a group of piles. referring now to fig1, a single pile 1 is shown as having been driven into soil 17. a pair of anchor piles 7 also have been driven into soil 17, at a distance at least seven feet away from or clear of pile 1, i. e., away from the pile 1 under test. a bottom flange 19 of a test beam 6 is set on top of a bearing plate 5 of a piston ram 4 of a hydraulic cylinder 2. the hydraulic cylinder 2 is set on a test plate 3, which is centered on top of the individual pile 1, i. e., the single pile 1. the test beam 6 is tied to the anchor piles 7 by means of a series of connecting rods 8, a pair of plates 9 on a top flange 18 of the beam 6, and the connecting rods 8 are secured by a series of threaded nuts 10, threaded down against the plates 9. by the conventional method, a powerful, upwardly driven push is provided by the piston ram 4 of the hydraulic cylinder 2, as represented by an arrow 15. this upwardly driven push is exerted upon the test beam 6, by means of a bearing plate 5, which bears on the bottom flange 19 of the beam 6. the beam 6 is fixedly connected to the anchor piles 7 by means of the threaded nuts 10, tightened on the connecting rods 8, against the plates 9. as a result, the beam 6 cannot move up. the forceful push of the pistons 4 is effectively resisted by the anchor piles 7 because of the friction between the anchor piles 7 and the soil 17. an equivalent forceful push therefore is exerted downwardly on the test plate 3 and, as a result, on the individual pile 1. accordingly to astm d1143 - 81 ( reapproved 1987 ), the load applied upon the pile 1, which is the pile under test, must be 200 % of the anticipated individual pile 1 design load. the scope of purpose for testing piles is to determine if the pile has adequate bearing capacity, by measuring the response of the pile, e. g., the pile 1, to a static, compressive load, axially applied, as shown by an arrow 16 of fig1. in addition, pile testings also are utilized for measuring pile movements under axial loading. fig1 shows a pair of dial gages 11, connected by means of a pair of stems 20 to the pile 1, at a pair of lugs 14 and to a pair of reference beams 13 by means of a pair of supports 12. referring now to fig2, the conventional testing apparatus and method for a group of piles 40 is represented. pile group 40 includes, by the way of an example, the two piles 40 which have been driven into a soil 53. a series of anchor piles 47 also have been driven into the soil 53 at a distance at least seven feet away from or clear of any pile 40, i. e., the pile 40 of the pile group under test. a bottom flange 57 of a test beam 56 is set on top of a bearing plate 45 of a ram 44 of a hydraulic cylinder 43. the hydraulic cylinder 43 is set on a test plate 42, which in turn is set on a pile cap 41. the pile cap 41 is centered on top of pile group 40. the pile cap 41 is constructed of reinforced concrete, which is engineered to bear the anticipated load. the test beam 56 has a pair of beams 61 on its top flange 46. a pair of beams 58 are set with their bottom flanges 59 on top of the i - beams 61. this i - beam set up is all tied down to the anchor piles 47 by means of a series of connecting rods 48 and threaded nuts 52, with a plate 51 on top of each flange 60. the threaded nuts 52 are tightened down against the plates 51. by the conventional method, a powerful, upwardly driven push is provided by the piston 44 of the hydraulic cylinder 43, as represented by an arrow 54. this upwardly driven push is exerted upon the test beam 56 by means of the bearing plate 45, which bears on the bottom flange 57 of the beam 56. the beam 56 is fixedly connected to the anchor piles 47 by means of the threaded nuts 52 tightened on the connecting rods 48, against the plates 51. as a result, the beam 56 cannot move up. the forceful push of the piston 44 is effectively resisted by the anchor piles 47 because of the friction between the piles 47 and the soil 53. an equivalent, forceful push is exerted therefore downwardly upon the test plate 42, the pile cap 41, and the pile group 40, as represented by an arrow 55. accordingly to astm d1143 - 81 ( reapproved 1987 ), the load applied upon the pile group 40, which is the pile group under test, must be 150 % of the anticipated pile group 40 design load. these astm tests are performed to determine if the pile group has adequate bearing capacity by measuring the response of the pile group, e. g., the pile group 40, to a static, compressive load applied axially, as shown in fig2. the pile group 40 also is tested to determine movements which occur under loading. fig2 shows a pair of dial gages 51 connected by means of a pair of stems 49 to a pile cap 41 and to a pair of reference beams 53 by means of a pair of supports 52. referring now to fig3, a pair of reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 in accordance with the apparatus and the methods of the present invention are shown in the process of testing a single pile 90 under a static, axial load, provided by a hydraulic assembly 145. the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 provide a point of resistance for a pair of hydraulic cylinders 93 to push against, as the hydraulic cylinders 93 exert a specified testing load on the pile 90, as further described in this detailed description. the reaction anchors and support assemblies 125 are manufactured by safe foundations, inc., of pittsburgh, pa. the hydraulic cylinders 93 are set on a bearing plate 91, also known as a test plate 91, with a pair of pistons 94, respectively, upon which a bearing plate 92 is set. the hydraulic assembly could include only a one cylinder and one piston set instead of the pair of cylinders and pistons as shown in fig3 and 6. a load cell 121 is set between the bearing plate 92 and a bearing plate 122. the bearing plates 91, 92, and 122 are of sufficient thickness to support the test loads provided by the hydraulic assembly 145 without bending, but not less than two inches thick. the plate 122 bears against a flange 142 of a novel i - beam assembly 116. the i - beam assembly 116 bears against an i - beam assembly 115, which is identical to the beam assembly 116. a pair of flanges 143 of the i - beam assembly 115 are set on top of a pair of flanges 105 of the i - beam assembly 116. the beam assembly 115 is set at ninety degrees of the beam assembly 116 and on top of the beam assembly 116, as shown in fig4, a perspective view, showing some of the elements shown in fig3. referring now to fig3, 4, and 8, each of the beam assemblies 115 and 116 is constructed of two parallel i - beams, with one rod centering box 96 at each end of each assembly 115 and 116. a detail of the rod centering box 96 is shown in fig8, a perspective view of rod centering box 96. one box 96 is welded at each end of each beam assembly 115 and 116. the boxes 96 are made of plates 99 welded to the top flanges 105 and 106 of the beam assembly 116 and 115, respectively, and of l - shaped bars 100, also welded to the flanges 105 and 106, respectively. the rod centering boxes 96 are completed by plates 97, also welded to flanges 105 and 106 respectively. the plates 99 are also welded to the angled bars 100 and to the plates 97. angled bars 104 are welded to each end of the i - beams 115 and 116, respectively. with one rod centering box 96, and one angled bar 104 welded to each end of each pair of i - beams, very strong, novel reaction frames, i. e., beam assemblies 115 and 116, are formed. support plates 101, shown lifted - up from box 96 in fig8 are utilized to receive threaded rods 102 of the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125. nuts 103 in fig3 and 4 are threaded onto the rods 102 and tightened against the support plates 101. the plates 101 can slide inside their respective centering box 96 to facilitate positioning the beam assemblies 115 and 116 over rods 102. referring now to fig3 and 7, the hydraulic assembly 145 is shown set upon the test plate 91. the test plate 91 is set on top of the pile 90, which is the pile under test, as shown in fig3. to test the pile 90 for determining its capability of supporting its design load, a compressive load is axially applied upon the longitudinal axis of the pile 90, the compressive load being provided by the hydraulic assembly 145. the pistons 94 of the hydraulic assembly 145 forcefully push, upwardly, against the bearing plate 92. this upward push of the pistons 94 is transmitted to the beam assemblies 115 and 116. since the beam assemblies 115 and 116 are anchored by the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125, the beam assemblies 115 and 116 cannot move upwardly. the forceful upward push of the pistons 94, as they are forced out of their respective cylinders 93, is actually exerted axially, downwardly upon the pile 90, by means of the bottoms of the cylinders 93, upon the bearing plate 91. referring to fig3, a pair of dial gages 109 have their stems 118 connected to a top surface 191 of the bearing plate 91 and to a pair of reference beams 110 by means of a pair of supports 147. the stems 118 must have, at a minimum, two inches ( 5 cm ) of travel, must have a precision of at least 0. 01 inches ( 0. 25 millimeters ) and must read to one sixty - fourth ( 1 / 64 ) of an inch ( 4 mm ). the dial gages 109 provide the measurement of any longitudinal axial movement of the pile 90 under the axial loading provided by the hydraulic assembly 145. any axial movement beyond that specified renders the pile 90 unacceptable for its specified load. referring to fig3 and 6, the hydraulic assembly utilized in the apparatus and the method of the present invention could include a single hydraulic cylinder with its piston or a pair of cylinders 93 of a hydraulic assembly 95 of fig6, with a pair of pressure gages 117, one pressure gage 117 for each hydraulic cylinder 93 and a master pressure gage 116, and further includes a hydraulic pump 113 and an automatic pressure control device 114. the cylinders 93 are connected to the pump 113 by a pair of common manifolds 111 and hoses 112. the complete hydraulic assembly 95 is to be calibrated as a unit, including the hydraulic cylinders 93, the pistons 94, the pressure gages 117 and 116, the pump 113, and the automatic pressure control device 114. fig7 represents the preferred embodiment of the hydraulic means utilized by the apparatus and the methods of the present invention. the hydraulic assembly 145 is very similar to the hydraulic assembly 95. nevertheless, the hydraulic assembly 145 utilizes a calibrated load cell 121 between the bearing plate 92 and the bearing plate 122. in accord with the apparatus and the methods of the present invention, the calibrated load cell 121 is connected to a read - out and load graph recorder 124. the read - out recorder 124 provides a graph 148 showing the load applied during a 24 - hour period. the calibrated load cell 121 and the read - out and load graph recorder 124 substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of the measurements of the loads applied to the pile - under - test 90. the preferred embodiment for the hydraulic means, e. g., the hydraulic assembly 145, also includes the pressure gages 117, one for each hydraulic cylinder 93 and the master pressure gage 116, the hydraulic pump 113, and the automatic pressure control 114. the cylinders 93 are connected to the pump 113 by the common manifolds 111 and the hoses 112. this apparatus and method provide a dual measuring system. the load cell 121 must be calibrated to an accuracy of not less than 2 % of the applied load. referring again to fig3, the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125, also referred to as anchor assemblies 125, are shown inside earthen holes 126. the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 include anchoring heads 133 and a pipe column 128, which has four fins 129, only three shown, welded longitudinally to the surface of pipe column 128 and at ninety degrees to each other. the pipe columns 128 also have top plates 130 welded to their tops, which have a center hole to allow dywidag rod 102 pass through it, with a minimum clearance, in order to allow dywidag nuts 132 to be tightened against the plates 130 when threaded down on the dywidag rods 102. the dywidag rods, the nuts, and other dywidag products are manufactured by dywidagsystems international, u. s. a., inc., of fairfield, n. jersey. the anchoring heads 133 have the dywidag rods 125 and a plate support 138 formed by four ninety - degree bars, only two being shown, with a plate 137 welded on their top and four compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139, only three being shown. a collar 135 is welded on top of the plate 137 and is utilized to insert end 134 of the pipe column 128 into the collar 135 or over the collar 135, depending on pipe sizes utilized. four bolts 136, only three shown, are utilized for firmly securing the pipe column 128 to the anchor head 133. the dywidag rod 102 is inserted through a centerhole in a frusto - cone 140. a dywidag nut 141 is threaded on the end of the rod 102 and prevents the frusto - cone 140 from falling down. a nut 168 is hand tightened on the dywidag rod 102, on top of the frusto - cone 140, as seen in fig4. the main purpose of the nut 141 is to carry the frusto - cone 140 upwardly whenever the rod 102 is pulled up, during the process of anchoring the reaction anchor and support assembly 125, prior to installing the test beam assemblies 115 and 116. during the installation of the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125, hydraulic force is utilized for pulling up on the rod 102. the pulling on the rod 102 forces the nut 141 to push the frusto - cone 140 upwardly, which in turn pushes the compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139 upwardly and outwardly. the pulling on the rod 102 makes the pivoting plates 139 swing upwardly and outwardly, thereby compacting and consolidating soil 127 at the bottom of the earthen hole 126, effectively anchoring the assembly 125 against the soil 127 at the bottom of the earthen hole 126, thus providing the reaction point needed for the pile test. a nut 132 is threaded downwardly and hand tightened against the plate 130 at the top of the pipe column 128 in order to prevent the rod 102 and the frusto - cone 140 from moving back down. the top end of the reaction anchor and support assembly 125 is left a few inches above grade in order to facilitate its retrieval for further use. holes 131 are utilized for hooking a lifting device. the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 are installed at a distance of at least seven feet, clear distance, from the pile 90. the pile 90 of fig3 is shown as a round, cylindrical pile. nevertheless, the pile 90 can be an h - pile, an l - pile, a square pile, or an orthogonal pile. the pile 90 can be a concrete pile, whether cast - in - place or pre - cast, a pipe pile, or a timber pile, by the way of an example. the test set up shown in fig3 requires four reaction anchor and support assemblies 125, as shown in fig4, in order to provide an anchored reaction capacity, which is greater than the axial load applied to the pile 90 by the hydraulic assembly 145. the axial loading or test loading required for testing single piles is at least 200 % of the pile design load capacity. nevertheless, smaller piles require smaller test loads, and only one pair of reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 are required for smaller piles. on occasion, three pairs of reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 are required. in such cases, an additional beam assembly is installed upon the beam assembly 115 and at fortyfive degrees from it. the additional pair of reaction anchor and support assemblies are installed as shown for the beam assemblies 115 and 116 and in a substantially similar manner as shown for the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 of fig3 and 4. referring now to fig5, one reaction anchoring and support assembly is shown of the four reaction anchoring and support assemblies of fig3, 4, and 9. the one reaction anchoring and support assembly is shown in the process of being installed inside a pre - augured earthen hole 126, in preparation for utilization in the testing of the single pile 90 of fig3 or group pile 180 of fig9. the reaction anchor and support assembly 125 of fig5 provides the anchored reaction capacity required to resist the upward push of the hydraulic assemblies 145 of fig3, 4, and 9. the upward push of the hydraulic assemblies 145 provides the resultant downward axial loading required for testing the single pile 90 of fig3 or the group pile 180 of fig9. the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 are brought to the test site in one piece, pre - assembled, with the anchoring head 133 pre - attached to the rod 102 and with the rod 102 inside the pipe column 128. the compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139 come to the test site vertically down and parallel to the rod 102, with the frusto - cone 140 below the tip end of the compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139. the frusto - cone 140 is sandwiched between the nut 168, on its topside, as shown in fig4 and the nut 141 on its bottom side as shown in fig5. the pivoting plates 139 come with breakable tie - wire ( not shown ) around them, in order to keep them in a vertical position, which facilitates lowering down the anchor assembly 125 inside the pre - augured earthen hole 126. the nut 132 comes to the test site hand tightened against the plate 130. the reaction anchor and support assembly 125 is lowered down inside the earthen hole 126. about six inches of the top end of the reaction anchor and support assembly 125 is left above ground level 166. a centering collar 163 is placed over the assembly 125 and pushed down inside the earthen hole 126, until its plate 162 rests on surface 166 of the soil 126. the collar 163 is about twelve to eighteen inches long. the centering collar 163 is utilized for centering the reaction anchor assembly 125 inside the earthen hole 126 and to make sure it is fixed in a true, vertical and leveled position. when the correct leveling is attained, four pins 165 ( only two are shown ) are hammered down into the soil 127, through holes 164 of the plate 162, in order to immobilize the centering collar in a vertical position. next, the hydraulic assembly 150 is placed over the rod 102, i. e., with the rod 102 passing through openings 155 and 156 on plates 152 and 153, respectively. this is done by means of a crane, which is available at the job site anyways for handling the piles. the hydraulic assembly 145 of fig7 could be utilized instead of the hydraulic assembly 150 of fig5, if plates 91, 92, 94, and the load cell 121 had an opening through their center, for allowing the rod 102 pass through it. the preferred embodiment provides for utilizing one single hydraulic assembly to perform both the installation of all the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 prior to testing, as well as providing the specified loading for testing the single pile 90 of fig3 or the pile group 180 of fig9. in such an embodiment, the load cell 121 also has a center hole. if the load cell 121 also is utilized for installing the anchor assembly 125, then it could be installed between the plate 91 of fig7 and the plate 130 of fig5. the utilization of the load cell 121 and the read - out / graph recorder 124 is not a requirement for the installation of the reaction anchoring and support assemblies 125. nevertheless, the utilization of the load cell 121 and the read - out / graph recorder 124 is an additional quality control feature as well as a record keeping feature and a component part of the present invention. when the hydraulic assembly 150 is set on top of the plate 130, a plate 167 is placed over the rod 102 and set on top of the plate 153 to reduce the actual size of opening 156 so that the dywidag nut 103 can be threaded down on the rod 102 and hand tightened against the plates 167 and 153. the hydraulic assembly 150 has cylinders 151 connected by means of hoses 158 through the assembly & # 39 ; s inlets 157 to a hydraulic pump 159. a master pressure gage 168 is provided in series with both the cylinders 151 and the pump 159. a pressure gage 169 provides a reading of the pressures applied by the pistons 154, in pounds per - square inch, p. s. i. the total force exerted by the assembly is directly proportional to the diameter of pistons 154. the diameter of the pistons 154 determines the area in square inches of the cross section of each piston 154, which pistons 154 are substantially identical pistons. therefore, the total combined area is determined in advance. the operator is provided with a simple table showing how many tons - force are equivalent to various p. s. i. readings from the gage 169. the operator does not calculate anything. the compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139 are at the bottom of the earthen hole 126 in a vertical position parallel to the rod 102. the next step is to swing upwardly the pivoting plates 139 to anchor the assembly firmly against the soil 127 at the bottom of the hole 126. the operator provides hydraulic pressure to the cylinder 151, through the bottom inlets 157, which forces the pistons 154 upwardly. the pistons 154 forcefully push against the plates 153, 167 and the nut 103. that forceful upward push as represented by arrows 160 and as exerted on the nut 103, which is threaded onto the rod 102, lifts the rod 102 up, which in turn carries the nut 141 up with it. the nut 141 is threaded to the bottom end of the rod 102. the nut 141 pushes up the frusto - cone 140, which in turn forces the pivoting plates 139 to break their tie - wire ( not shown ). the pivoting plates 139 are forced to swing upwardly, compacting and consolidating the soil 127 at the bottom of the hole 126 by the expanding plates, i. e., by the expansion of the pivoting plates 139, thereby powerfully anchoring assembly the 125 to the soil at the bottom of the hole 126. as the rod 102 is being slowly, yet powerfully pushed upwardly, the operator hand - tightens down the nut 132 against the plate 130, thereby preventing the pivoting plates 139 from collapsing back down, which is a very rear situation. now the hydraulic assembly 150 is removed, by first reversing the flow of hydraulic fluid, which now is pumped by the pump 159, through the upper inlets 157, which in turn brings the pistons 154 back inside of their respective cylinders 151. then the hydraulic pressure is released and the nut 103 and the plate 167 are removed. finally, the hydraulic assembly 150 is removed and the installation of the next anchoring assemblies 125 can be started, until all four assemblies required per fig3, 4 and 9 are installed. preferably, the centering collar 163 stays installed, one on each anchoring assembly 125 until the pile test is concluded and the anchoring assemblies 125 are removed. as opposed to the conventional methods, whereby the anchor piles utilized in the testing remain in the ground and their tops must be sawed off, the reaction anchoring and support assemblies 125 are reusable. the anchoring and support assemblies 125 are retrievable. they are retrieved from the earthen hole 126 utilizing the same hydraulic assembly they were installed with. in order to retrieve the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 from the earthen hole 126, after the pile testing is completed, first the operator places the hydraulic assembly 150 once more over the rod 102, by means of an on - site crane. then the operator lowers the assembly down so that the rod 102 passes through the hole 155 on the bottom plate 152 and through the hole 156 of the top plate 153. now, the plate 167 is reinstalled, and the nut 103 is rethreaded down on the rod 102 and hand tightened against the plate 167. the operator then pumps hydraulic fluid through the lower inlets 157, by means of the pump 159. this forces the pistons 154 out of their respective cylinders 151, slowly but forcefully pushing upwardly against the plates 153 and 167 and on the nut 103 which, being threaded onto the rod 102, slowly lifts the rod 102 upwardly. this is done just enough to release the enormous pressure exerted by the nut 132 against the plate 130 at the time the anchor and support assembly 125 was installed. now the operator threads the nut 132 upwardly on the rod 102 and then releases the pressure from the pump 159, which releases the upward push of the pistons 154. next the nut 103 and the plate 167 are removed, and the operator pumps again hydraulic fluid through the lower inlets 157, by means of the pump 159, to make the pistons 154 extend out of the cylinders 151 for a distance which is approximately equal to the distance the pistons 154 were extended during the process of installation. the hydraulic assembly then is lifted up again, by means of a crane, just enough, so that the top end of the rod 102 is below the plate 153, in order to allow re - introducing the plate 167, which now will be on top of the nut 132, which has been threaded up. then, the operator lowers down the hydraulic assembly and sets its bottom plate 152 back on top of the plate 130 of the reaction anchor and support assembly 125 and with the rod 102 passing through the hole 156 of the top plate 153. the operator further threads up the nut 132 carrying the plate 167 upwardly until the plate 167 is against the bottom of the plate 153 with the nut 132 hand - tightened under it. now the operator pumps hydraulic fluid through the upper inlets 157, which forces the pistons 153 back down, slowly but forcefully pushing downwardly on the nut 132, which now is under the plates 167, 153 and is threaded onto the rod 102. therefore the pistons 154, slowly yet powerfully, push the rod 102 down. since the nut 168, shown on fig4, is threaded onto the rod 102 and it is on top and in contact with the frusto - cone 140, it pushes the frusto - cone 140 also downwardly. by pushing the frusto - cone 140 downwardly, the compaction and consolidation pivoting plates 139 are effectively released from the powerful force which kept them pressed against the soil at the bottom of the earthen hole 126. with the pivoting plates 139 collapsed back down to a vertical position, now the hydraulic assembly can be finally removed, as previously described, after releasing the hydraulic pressure. a job - site crane then is utilized for lifting the anchor and support assembly 125 out of the earthen hole 126. openings 131 on fins 129 are utilized for helping in lifting the assembly by means of devises and the job - site crane. referring now to fig9, the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125, utilized by the methods of the present invention, are shown in the process of testing a pile group 180 under a static axial load provided by the hydraulic assembly 145. the pile group 180 includes two or more single piles 182. the pile group 180 is capped with a reinforced concrete cap 181 engineered and constructed specifically for the anticipated test loads. the hydraulic cylinders 93 are set on the bearing plate 91, with their respective pistons 94, upon which the bearing plate 92 is set. the load cell 121 is set in between the bearing plate 92 and the bearing plate 122. the bearing plates 91, 92 and 122 are of sufficient thickness to support the test loads provided by the hydraulic assembly 145 without bending, but not less than two inches thick. the plate 122 bears against the flange 142 of i - beam assembly 116. the i - beam assembly 116 bears against the i - beam assembly 115, which is identical to the beam assembly 116. the flanges 143 of the i - beam assembly 115 are set on top of the flanges 105 of i - beam assembly 116. the beam assembly 115 is set at ninety degrees of the beam assembly 116 in the horizontal plane and on top of it. the construction of the i - beam assemblies 115 and 116 of fig9 is substantially the same as described in reference to fig3 and 4. the hydraulic assembly 145 of fig9 also is substantially the same as described in reference to fig3 and 7. nevertheless, for the pile group 180 testings, a larger axial load is required, for a larger capacity for the hydraulic cylinders 93, with their respective pistons 94, possibly, of larger diameter than it would be required for single pile testings. the reaction anchor and support assemblies 125 of fig9 are also substantially the same as described in reference to fig3, 4 and 5. on occasion, a third pair of assemblies 125 is utilized in order to provide the reaction capacity required for the loading specified for a specific pile group test. continuing to refer to fig9, the instrumentation set up is substantially similar to that described in reference to fig3. nevertheless, for the group pile testing of fig9, the dial gages 109 have their stems 118 connected to the top of the concrete cap. the dial gages 109 are connected to reference the beams 110 by means of the supports 147. the stems 118 must have, at a minimum, two inches ( 5 cm ) of travel, must have a precision of at least 0. 01 inches ( 0. 25 millimeters ) and must read to one sixty - fourth ( 1 / 64 ) of an inch. these dial gages provide the measurement of any longitudinal axial movement of the pile group 180 under the axial load provided by the hydraulic assembly 145. any axial movement beyond that specified, renders pile 90 unacceptable for its specified load. other instrumentation means are available for measuring other single pile and group pile movements under axial test loadings. by the novel methods of the present invention, single piles or group piles are tested utilizing one, two, or more pairs of reaction anchor and support assemblies, as shown in fig3, 4, and 9 and as described in the detailed description, instead of utilizing one, two, or more pairs of anchor piles which cannot be reutilized for future pile or pile group tests. the testing process of the present invention does not depart from the procedures established by the a. s. t. m. standards for testing piles or pile groups. the novelty of this invention includes the utilization of the novel anchor and reaction anchoring and support assembly in combination with the novel i - beam assembly, with a built - in centering box. this combination, in addition to its reusability feature, is a safer and more reliable anchoring system than the conventional anchor piles utilized by the conventional methods. the mechanical connections between the conventional reaction beam and the conventional anchor piles of the conventional methods are substantially more susceptible to elongation under the axial pressures involved in the test than the dywidag rod and dywidag nuts combination utilized by this invention. the component parts of the reaction anchor and support assembly of this invention have been utilized under axial loadings several times larger than the loads involved in pile tests. the safety and reliability of the methods of this invention are demonstrated further by the anchoring method of this invention, which compacts and consolidates the soil it is anchored to, with the compaction and consolidation increasing, thus increasing the anchoring capacity, as the test loading increases. this can be understood readily by looking at the drawings in fig3, 5, and 9, showing the swingable pivoting plates anchored and pushing upwardly, at the bottom of an earthen hole, such that the more the test load pulls up on the dywidag rod, the more powerfully the anchoring head gets anchored to the soil at the bottom of the hole. the apparatus and method of the present invention substantially contrast with the conventional anchor piles, which depend absolutely on the friction between the pile and the soil into which it was hammered down. in the conventional application, the more the test load pulls the anchor pile up, the greater are the chances the pile will slide up, and often the piles do slide up. as it can be seen by a review of the detailed description, the apparatus and method of the present invention accomplish all of its stated objectives. the apparatus and methods of the present invention are capable of modifications and variations without departing from the scope thereof. accordingly, the detailed description and examples set forth above are meant to be illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.",pile testing apparatus and method apply static compressive forces on a pile to be tested for load bearing capacity . retractable and reusable reaction anchor assemblies are installed into the ground for pile testing and then are retrieved from the ground after completion of the pile testing and are reused from one pile test site to another . the invention operates to receive an equal and opposite reaction force on an i - beam and provide at least two retractable and reusable reaction anchor assemblies installed into the ground at a depth significantly less than required with conventional pile testing methods . the i - beam is braced by the two retractable and reusable reaction anchor assemblies and held stationary in counter - action against the opposite reaction force on the i - beam . the pile testing apparatus and method of the present invention reduce costs considerably and can be used immediately as contrasted to conventional methods using concrete .
"an interactive electronic bearer document ( iebd ) is a unique unit of trade. similar to a bearer bond, it is payable to whoever possesses it. an iebd is not linked to any one person & # 39 ; s identity. the present invention allows for consumers and merchants to use iebds as a method of electronic payment. iebds may be used anywhere the need for a transaction occurs. furthermore, the iebds may be acquired by consumers in their own local currency. since the iebds may be used in any international market, a rate of exchange is applied to each country & # 39 ; s currency. the use and trade of iebds is facilitated through the use of a secure bearer document database ( bdd ). this database processes and stores all information pertaining to and associated with the trade of iebds. owners of iebds and merchants may access the database through several different venues including, but not limited to, websites such as the universal cash online ( uco ) website, telephone interface systems such as the uco telephone interface system, and kiosks such as the uco kiosk. advantageously, a multitude of anonymous consumers from many different countries are able to utilize iebds and associated uco products and services regardless of their age or their credit worthiness. unlike credit or bank accounts, a uco consumer is not required to provide any information concerning his or her identity. the iebds may be purchased by consumers from various off - line ( i. e. brick and mortar ) and on - line points of sale including, but not limited to : banks, post offices, internet service providers, retail stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, and web sites such as the uco web site. according to an embodiment of the present invention, iebds are not valid and may not be used for purchases until they have been authorized by an affiliated vendor. for an iebd to be authorized, for example, a vendor inputs its vendor identification number ( vin ) along with the iebd account number to authorize the card for use. iebds may be made available to consumers in their local currency. the value of an iebd is linked to a base currency. a common base currency which may be selected is u. s. dollars, because u. s. currency is generally universally accepted. the consumer pays an appropriate exchange rate to convert his or her type of currency into the equivalent base currency. due to the currency exchange features of iebds, they become effectively a universally acceptable method of payment. advantageously, the present invention allows for a user to set up and activate either a uco card account, or a credit card account. this is achieved by, for example, the user entering the ucash web site by selecting account activation, including the type of account to be set up ( uco card or credit card ) by entering ucash card and personal information, by choosing a password, and by receiving an account number on - line, wherein the account number may be either a uco card account number or a credit card account number, such as a visa or mastercard account number. after an iebd is authorized, the consumer may use the iebd to perform electronic transactions. an initial secure pin is printed on the card, but may be concealed by scratch off or peeler media. in order to perform a transaction, the consumer provides the iebd account number, the initial pin, and any other pertinent information printed on the iebd medium ( e. g. date printed, country of purchase, or other information ) to the merchant. advantageously, the uco consumer has the ability to change the pin number at any time via the uco web site or over the phone to further secure access to their funds. every transaction which is performed using an iebd is stored on the bdd. if the proper security information is provided, this information along with other transaction data may be accessed through the uco web site. the uco web site also provides additional features for convenience and security including, but not limited to : shopping online, transaction histories, language translations, merchant validation, currency conversions, shippers online, tariff information, anonymous e - mail, bulletin boards, luck draw process, interactive features, and concierges services. the interactive features allow the owner to control the use of the funds represented by the iebd. these features may be accessed and activated through a portal such as the uco web portal. initial verification information may be supplied to gain limited access to the central transaction database including the account number of the iebd and a secure pin. an individual iebd has no value until it is authorized by the central transaction bdd. the iebds may be authorized through a set of pre - defined protocols, or they may be authorized in a manner prescribed by a bdd operator. the owner of the iebd may opt to use all or a portion of the available funds to perform electronic transactions. an authorized amount is deducted from the total amount. the remaining value can be securely vaulted until authorized for use. after card activation, a user may check the balance of his or her card after activation by, for example, selecting the type of card ( uco card or credit card ) for the desired balance, providing the chosen card number, providing a password for the debit card accounts, if any, and by viewing the current balance of the chosen card displayed on - screen. a user is also able to check his or her statement on - line by, for instance, selecting a type of card ( uco card or credit card ), providing the chosen card number, providing 0a password for the debit card accounts, if any, and by viewing the statement of the chosen card displayed on - screen. the statement is generated from the transactions stored on the bdd. furthermore, a user may transfer funds between accounts. a user may transfer funds from a uco card account to a debit card account. as a result, the balance of the debt card account may be increased. the user may transfer either the entire remaining balance of the uco card or fixed portions of the balance to the account. a user may also transfer funds from credit card accounts to a uco card. several iebds of the same or differing amounts may be consolidated into one iebd via the web portal. iebd holders may further secure their funds by providing additional personal information. a user may authorize a one - time purchase using either a uco card or credit card. for example, this may be accomplished by the user selecting either a uco card or credit card, by entering in the account number of the chosen card, by entering in a password for the card, and by selecting a duration and amount for which the one - time purchase will be valid for. optionally, the user may select certain restrictions on the one - time certificate so that the certificate cannot be used to purchase certain types of goods and / or services. moreover, the owner of an iebd may also select where the document may be spent. after all such information is entered, the user is presented with an account number which can be used for a one - time purchase. once the certificate is created, an owner of the certificate may use the certificate on - line. the certificate works identically to visa / mc number, with the advantage that it does not require address / name / or zip verification, resulting in anonymous purchases. anonymous e - mail communication is another unique feature that is available through the web site for iebd holders. this feature allows consumers to create an email account that is linked to their iebd account. as a result, the e - mail account is not linked to the identity of the holder of the iebd. iebd holders may receive or send mail and check their transaction history. they may also use the e - mail platform to facilitate purchases, release their vaulted funds, and perform balance transfers to other card accounts. the uco e - mail account is linked to the iebd account and may be initially accessed by the uco scratch off pin. upon activation of the card, the anonymous email accounts remain active as long as they are linked to a valid iebd account. when the balance of an iebd is consumed or expired, a new valid iebd may be linked to an existing e - mail account. the anonymous e - mail features of the present invention advantageously enable consumers who may not possess an e - mail account or a computer to : communicate with friends and family, receive order reference and confirmation information, and to transfer funds to other uco cardholders. through the use of collaborative filtering techniques, uco merchants may target anonymous uco consumers via their anonymous e - mail accounts by their spending habits alone. this customer anonymity encourages spending on the part of the uco customer, which, in turn, helps merchants to more correctly identify the spending habits of uco customers. furthermore, a uco bulletin board may be accessed from the uco web site. the uco bulletin board allows for uco merchants to conduct direct marketing and sales to anonymous uco cardholders. uco cardholders searching for the best deal on a particular item may post their request for that item on the bulletin board. merchants servicing that market are able to browse these requests and respond to the consumer & # 39 ; s anonymous e - mail account with an offer to provide the specific requested goods and / or services. the consumer may then select the best value from several merchants who made offers in response to the consumer & # 39 ; s request. this service effectively brings the merchants to the consumers. therefore, merchants no longer have to wait passively for consumers who have very specific needs to come to them. uco consumer data calculators ( cdcs ) are available to aid uco consumers as they search and shop online. for instance, a uco customer is able to convert their iebds into any currency of the world, in real time, at the official rates of exchange. furthermore, the present invention provides comparison shop search engines which query the uco database. the search engines may be offered to uco consumers by, for example, the uco web site. using the search engines, consumers are able to compare, for example, a us product with its chinese counterpart. comparisons detailing the cost of shipping, tariffs, taxes, clearing and forwarding, and time to ship are advantageously available to international consumers and national consumers alike. the present invention further provides other services to uco customers, including uco purchasing services. through the uco purchasing services an iebd becomes a universally acceptable method of payment. for instance, in the event that a merchant does not accept an iebd as a method of payment, uco purchasing services provides payment to a merchant on behalf of a uco customer & # 39 ; s iebd, via a payment method that the merchant does accept ( e. g. visa, mc, amex, check, money order, wire transfer, or other form of payment ). in order to facilitate and monitor the trading of interactive electronic bearer documents ( iebds ), the present invention collects and stores information pertaining to the iebds in the bdd. every data entry in the bdd is related to an account number of an individual iebd. the present invention allows consumers to purchase universal cash online ( uco ) cards anonymously online using their credit cards. the process allows online merchants or retailers to sell uco cards without any knowledge of the unique account identifier or pin number associated with a uco card. the present invention further allows for organizations, including but not limited to isps, banks, private label organizations, and credit card companies, to be able to offer uco cards for sale online to their customers who prefer to use the anonymous features of uco cards over traditional credit cards where purchases are tied to a specific individual. as an example, a batch of uco cards may be supplied to online vendors with the account number hidden from view in special concealer packaging. this packaging conceals the account numbers, while clearly displaying a card batch number, denomination, and upc code for the uco card. although a vendor may not have access to the individual card account numbers, they may still sell these cards to their customers by entering the upc code that is printed on the outside of the card packaging. thereafter, the online consumer may then remove the concealer packaging exposing the card account and pin number. the consumer may then activate the card through a web site, such as the universal cash online web site. the associated credit card company, or other issuer of the uco card, would know that they had sold, for example, a $ 50 card to john doe. however, they would not be aware of the account number of the card. therefore, john doe is now free to perform online purchases anonymously using the uco card. the present invention, through universal cash online direct link services, allows for individual consumers to have the ability to chat and share information online directly with each other on a one - to - one basis via a web portal such as the uco web portal. these services are offered to allow for open consumer communication. this general exchange of information and opinions helps consumers to stay abreast of activities occurring in the cyber - marketplace. furthermore, consumers may form chat communicates pertaining to various specific topics. fig1 shows a uco payment system in accordance with the present invention. a description of the components comprising the payment system will first be described, with a description of the interaction between components following thereafter. iebd 10 may be a card, or any other form of readable media, including a virtual card, which represents a dollar value. according to an embodiment of the present invention, iebd 10 is not registered in the name of a particular individual. iebd 10 may be used to purchase goods and / or services by whoever possesses the correct password or pin written or displayed on the card. consumer 20 is an individual who has purchased an iebd 10 at any one of various points of sale, including off - line and on - line points of sale. merchant 30 is a merchant which has agreed to terms and conditions outlined for accepting iebds. web portal 40 is a website which offers consumers many e - commerce functions and services, including payment transactions. bank 50 is a financial institution which holds uco consumer payment accounts 53 and various merchant accounts 56. bdd 60 is software that processes internal payment transactions and coordinates payments from uco consumer 20 to uco merchant 30. server 70 is a computer used to coordinate processes between bdd 60 and external inputs including : web portal 40, bank 50, merchant 30, and consumer 20. consumer 20 elects to purchase goods and / or services from web portal 40. web portal 40 displays an itemized description of the products or services in the uco shopping cart along with pertinent transaction information including, but not limited to including : amount to complete transaction ( cost, tax, shipping, tariff, etc. ), shipping address, and merchant name and address. web portal 40 prompts, for example : is this correct? do you wish to continue? enter account #? upon receiving the account #, uco server 70 queries uco database 60 to determine if funds are available to complete the transaction. if sufficient funds are present, uco web portal 40 may prompt, for example : once the pin or password has been verified, uco server 70 connects with uco merchant 30 via internet 35. information from the shopping cart is sent to uco merchant 30. the web portal may prompt, for instance : if uco merchant 30 wishes to continue, uco web portal 40 instructs uco merchant 30 to initiate the order and transmit order reference data to uco server 70. next, the merchant initiates the order, and transmits order reference data as outlined in a standard terms and conditions statement. once the order reference data has been received, uco server 70 processes the information and initiates an internal funds transfer. this is accomplished by the following operations : 1. funds are transferred from the account associated with iebd 10 to a uco holding queue 66. 2. the purchase amount is deducted from uco consumer customer account 63. 3. transaction data is processed and deposited in, for instance, consumer in - box 69. at this point a uco consumers input is no longer required to complete the transaction. uco web portal 40 prompts uco consumer 20 : please change your pin or password before logging off. in order to receive payment, uco merchant 30 is required to transmit the confirmation data outlined in the agreed upon terms and conditions. uco merchant 30 transmits confirmation data to uco server 70. uco server 70 processes the confirmation data, and subtracts the transaction amount from uco holding queue 66, and deposits confirmation data in consumer & # 39 ; s in - box 69. uco server 70 establishes a secure connection with uco bank 50 to initiate an external funds transfer. uco server 70 instructs uco bank 50 to transfer the transaction amount from the uco account to the merchant account. uco bank 50 then performs the transfer of funds, by, for example, transmitting transaction data to uco server 70. uco server 70 processes the transaction data, transmits the transaction data to uco merchant 30 for verification, and deposits the final confirmation in uco consumer in - box 69. fig2 shows user - selectable uco services in accordance with the present invention. card services 100 allows a uco customer to purchase cards on - line and access their existing account or accounts. uco customers may purchase an uco card on -

"fig1 illustrates the basic block diagram of a digital vocoder incorporating a pitch period extraction circuit operating according to the algorithm of the present invention. speech input to the transmitter or speech analyzer is sampled and converted to a digital representation in the analog to digital converter 1. spectral parameters are derived from transmit filter 2 in the form of an adaptive filter and excitation parameter are derived from pitch period extraction circuit 3 and the voiced / unvoiced decision circuit 4. the spectrum parameter and excitation parameter are multiplexed in multiplexer 5 and transmitted to the receiver over transmission path 6. the transmited multiplexed signal is demultiplexed and the receiver is frame synchronized in demultiplexer and frame sync circit 7. the excitation parameter and spectrum parameter are coupled to excitation generator 8 and receive filter 9, respectively. filter 9 is an adaptive filter having its transfer function inverse to the transfer function of transmit filter 2. the output of filter 9 is coupled to digital to analog converter 10 to reproduce the original speech input. all processing from converter 1 in the transmitter to converter 10 in the receiver is digital and implemented with logic circuits. the basic block diagram of fig1 is more completely disclosed, with the exception of the pitch period extraction circuit which is the subject matter of the present application, in the copending application of j. g. dunn, j. p. cowen and a. j. russo, ser. no. 505, 808, filed sept. 13, 1974, having the same assignee as the present invention, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. to be consistent with the other components of fig1 the implementation of pitch period extraction circuit 3 which is described herein employs a hardware implementation using a multi - processing design with repetitive serial arithmetic units. referring to fig2 pitch period extraction circuit 3 basically includes a squarer 11 which multiplies the prediction residual at the output of filter 2 by itself and may take the form of the multiplier described with respect to fig1 of the above - cited copending application. the output of squarer 11 is a 32 - bit integer which is coupled to low pass filter 12 which is digital in nature and will be described hereinbelow with respect to fig3. the low pass filter 12 obtains the frequency and impulse responses of the prediction residual. the output of low pass filter 12 is coupled to pitch period analzer 13 which operates in accordance with the algorithm described hereinbelow and is implemented as described hereinbelow. the output of analyzer 13 is the extracted pitch period. to be consistent with the object of the above - cited copending application the adders and subtractors employed in connection with certain of the decision circuits of analyzer 13 are serial arithmetic units as fully disclosed in fig1 of the above - cited copending application. fig3 illustrates the block diagram of low pass filter 12 of fig2 and basically includes four 32 - bit delay registers 14, an adder 15 is coupled to each of the four delay registers 14. the output of adder 15 is coupled to three 32 - bit delay registers 16 with each of these registers having their outputs coupled to adder 17. the output of adder 17 is coupled to two 32 - bit delay registers 18 whose outputs are coupled to adder 19. the digital low pass filter employed is relatively simple since registers and adders are the only components employed therein. the low pass filter as just described has an effective measured dc ( direct current ) gain of 24. to avoid overflows in registers 14, 16 and 18, the squared residual from squarer 11 is divided by sixteen in divider 20 prior to application to the first of delay registers 14. this reduces the effective number of bits for the squared residual to 28. in addition, the output of the filter, namely, the output of adder 19 is divided by two in divider 21 before application to pitch period analyzer 13 of fig2. as a result, the overall measured dc filter gain is 0. 75. fig4 a and 4b, when organized as illustrated in fig4 c, illustrates the flow chart of the pitch period extraction algorithm of the present invention which when taken with the following table i of mnemonics will be self - explanatory and easily understood. the two sets of number reference characters in parentheses associated with the letter reference characters refer to the number reference characters of fig5 a and 5b and the number reference characters of fig8 f - 8i with the lower reference character numbers referring to fig5 a and 5b and the higher reference character numbers referring to fig8 f - 8i to enable a

another way of setting forth the decisions of the flow chart of fig4 a and 4b that takes place in this algorithm to determine the pitch period. the legends in the blocks of this block diagram are believed to be self - explanatory so as to enable implementing the algorithm as set forth in either fig4 a and 4b or fig5 a and 5b. however, the following is a brief description of the operation of the algorithm when related to the block diagram of fig5 a and 5b. as previously mentioned, the pitch period extraction algorithm operates in the time domain on a processed version of the time speech wave form, namely, the prediction residual. as shown in fig2 the algorithm and the implementation thereof can be broken down into three parts ; a squarer 11, a low pass filter 12, and a pitch period analyzer 13. the input is the prediction residual output of the predictive adaptive filter because the periodic signal that occurs during voiced segments of speech is greatly enhanced in the prediction residual by operation of the adaptive filter. this is an example of using the existing signal in one part of the system to improve the performance of another part of the system. to make the peaks of the prediction residual even more prominent and to reduce the noiselike characteristic of the signal in between peaks the prediction residual is squared and then low pass filtered. the filter has a 3 db ( decibal ) bandwidth of 750 hz ( hertz ) with 40 db attenuation at 2000 hz. this bandwidth was chosen because the pitch frequency of the human voice in general falls within the 0 - 750 hz frequency range. using the output of the low pass filter 12, pitch analyzer 13 determines the pitch period by locating the position of the peaks and then calculating the distance between them. the output of the low pass filter 12 is scanned for peaks on a sample by sample basis as indicated in block 21. the algorithm processes the input whenever a peak is located by following one of two basic paths depending on whether the present peak crosses time varying threshold as indicated in block 22. the threshold level is set as a fraction of the amplitude of the previously located pitch peak in the last searh window. within a search window the location and amplitude of the largest and second largest peak are continuously updated as each new peak is found as indicated by blocks 23 and 24. when a peak is found that exceeds threshold, its distance from the previous pitch peak is noted. if the new peak occurs less than 2. 5 milliseconds from the previous pitch peak that crossed the threshold, it is ignored since it is probably an extraneous peak and as indicated at block 25 the algorithm skips to the output circuit indicated in block 26 where the maximum peak parameters within the search window are initialized for a new search. when the peak is greater than 2. 5 milliseconds away from the previous pitch peak, the present peak is assumed to be a pitch peak. the pitch period is then calculated by subtracting the location of the new pitch peak from the previous pitch peak. the window length was also derived in case it had changed during the search. these later two operations are indicated in block 27. the new pitch period is compared to the value of the previous pitch period to see if it has dropped by more than 3 / 5 of the previous value as indicated in block 28. during a voiced period of speech a large change such as this would not normally occur, so that if the new period did take such a radical change it is assumed to be an error. a factor of 3 / 5 ( slightly greater than 1 / 2 ) is used to allow the algorithm to correct double pitch period errors which require a 50 % drop. only large decreases in pitch periods are prevented because large increases are required for correct operation in the transition from unvoiced to voiced speech. if the pitch period is assumed incorrect, the new pitch period is set equal to the previous value rather than using the calculated period as indicated in block 29 after passing through block 30 which determines if the speech is voiced or unvoiced. a pitch peak is assumed to be located where the assumed period would have it fall and all other parameters are adjusted to fit this assumption in block 29. the parameters for locating maximum peaks are initialized for the next search cycle in block 26. if the change in the calculated pitch period falls within the allowed range, or the large decrease falls during unvoiced speech, the pitch period is assumed correct. the assumed location of the next pitch peak is calculated by adding the pitch period to the location of the present pitch peak as indicated in block 31. this determines the location and width of the next search window. the threshold for the next search is calculated by taking 3 / 4 of the amplitude of the present pitch peak. the maximum peak parameters are then also initialized in block 26. this describes one of the two main paths that the algorithm can follow. the other path is followed when the presently located peak does not exceed threshold. in this case, the first step after finding the peak does not exceed threshold is to determine the present search location with respect to the end of the search window as indicated in block 32. if the search has not reached the end of the search window all parameters are left unchanged and are coupled to block 26. when the search has reached the end of the search window and no peaks have crossed threshold, a determination is made as to whether the correct pitch peak has been skipped because it would not exceed threshold. this is done by comparing the amplitude of the largest peak in the search window with the amplitude of the previous pitch peak as indicated in block 33. it is assumed that if the largest peak is less than 1 / 3 of the amplitude of the previous pitch peak the correct pitch peak has not yet been reached. therefore, the search window length is extended as indicated in block 34, the results of which are coupled to block 26. all other parameters are left unchanged. for the cases where the largest peak is greater than 1 / 3 of the previous pitch peak or the search has gone beyond the end of the window ( this could happen when the window has been extended ) it is assumed that the largest peak in the search window is the corrrect pitch peak as indicated in block 35. the pitch period is assumed equal to the previous value and the location parameters, such as the location of the next pitch peak, are achieved to fit the assumptions. since nothing has crossed threshold, threshold is set at 1 / 2 the amplitude of the assumed pitch peak. the window length parameter is also redefined in case it has changed during the search. it is possible that the present search location ( end of window ) is beyond where the next expected peak would be located as indicated in block 36. if this is not true, the results are intialized in block 26. if this is true, this peak may be missed altogether. therefore, when this condition occurs, the second highest peak within the search window is assumed to be a pitch peak if it is within 1. 25 milliseconds of the present search location as indicated in block 37. all of the location parameters are recalculated based on this assumption as indicated in block 38. if the present search location is not beyond the expected pitch peak location, and if the second highest peak is not within 1. 25 milliseconds of the present search location, the algorithm initializes the maximum peak parameter in block 26 as its final operation. for any of the paths taken through the algorithm, the final output at the end of a search cycle is the pitch period. the pitch period remains unchanged during a search cycle. since a search cycle ends with the location of a peak, which in effect determines the instantaneous pitch period, the calculated pitch period tracks the actual pitch period in real time. the basic operation of the algorithm involves making a series of decisions based on past and present data. the required storage is minimal since only a few parameters need be retained for the required decisions. therefore, from the view point of hardware implementation the algorithm is far simpler than a frequency domain or correlation approach. referring to fig7 there is illustrated therein the logic circuitry of a decision circuit that will be employed in the logic diagram of fig8 a - 8j implementing the algorithm of the present invention. each of the decision circuits includes inputs a and b coupled to full adder 39, jk flip - flop 40, and exclusive - or gate 41. the full adder has added thereto a d - type flip - flop 42 to provide a serial adder as employed in the above - cited copending application. the sum output of full adder 39 is coupled to d - type flip - flop 43. the truth table for this decision circuit is shown hereinbelow in table ii. referring to fig8 a - 8j, when organized as indicated in fig8 k, there is disclosed therein the logic diagram that implements the pitch period extraction algorithm of the present invention. the logic diagram includes multiplexers 44 - 55 associated with shift registers 56 - 62 and 65 - 69, as illustrated in fig8 a - 8e. the shift registers perform a dual function. they provide a means for storing the variables and also provide a one sample delay during which the decisions are made. as will be noted, the multiplexers 44 - 55 have signals applied to their widest side of the rectangular portion of the multiplexer symbol. these are the signal inputs to the multiplexers from various ones of the shift registers 56 - 62 and 65 - 69 together with constant values. a select signal or signals are applied to the narrow edge of the rectangular portion of the multiplexer symbols of certain of the multiplexers to select the signals applied to the wide side thereof in accordance with the selecting code illustrated in the rectangular portion of the multiplexer symbol for the coupling of input signals to the shift registers associated therewith and also to the decision circuits which are illustrated in fig8 f - 8i. the selecting signals for the multiplexers are derived from the decisions of the decision circuits by the flow logic shown in fig8 j, the outputs of which are applied directly or through intermediate gating circuits to the various selecting signal inputs of the multiplexers having selecting inputs. with the correct data ready to enter each of the registers 56 - 62 and 65 - 69, the data is clocked into the shift registers while at the same time being clocked through the decision circuitry. at the end of this cycle, both the input data has been stored in the registers and all the decisions which were set forth in the flow chart have been made. in the idle time following this, the answers from the decisions are transformed through the flow logic of fig8 j into the control commands or signal selectors of the multiplexers 44 - 55. at the start of the next cycle, these multiplexers 44 - 55 are set to admit the correct new values to the registers 56 - 62 and 65 - 69 and the process repeats itself. there are only two external inputs to the pitch analyzer circuit. one input is the 1 - bit decision from the voicing circuit which appears as input v / uv in fig8 h. this input is received every sample from the voicing circuit 4 ( fig1 ). the second input is the partially processed speech information referred to as absol which is the output of filter 12. this signal is illustrated in fig8 b and is a 32 - bit data word received serially on a sample by sample basis every 125 microseconds. shift registers 63 and 64 are provided to store the two previous samples. at the same time that the pitch analyzer is receiving the 12th bit of absol, the first bits of signals inrp and iprp, the pitch period from the previous sample and the pitch period from two samples ago, respectively, are being fed to the pitch correction circuit of the above - cited copending application from shift register 69 ( fig8 e ). both of these signals are 13 - bit data words which represent the integer number of samples from one to the next pitch peak and, therefore, the pitch period. a third signal numrat, a 32 - bit serial word is also available at the output of multiplexer 54 ( fig8 e ) and is sent to the voicing decision circuit 4 ( fig1 ). as the first bit of absol is being clocked into the pitch analyzer, the first bit of numrat is clocked into the voicing decision circuit 4 ( fig1 ). the pitch period output nsper is obtained from shift register 69 ( fig8 e ). the total time needed to cycle through the decisions is 32 clock periods. pitch period analysis is carried out during every sample period of 125 microseconds. the decision circuits illustrated in fig8 f - 8i will now be correlated with the decisions contained in the diamond - shaped blocks of the flow chart of fig4 a and 4b. the letter reference characters in parentheses in fig8 f - 8i refer to the letter reference characters of the diamond - shaped blocks of fig4 a and 4b to enable a correlation of the components of fig8 f - 8i with the diamond - shaped blocks of fig4 a and 4b. the decision for the diamond - shaped block a of the flow chart is performed by decision circuit 70 with the d1 decision being coupled to a d - type flip - flop 71 to provide the second decision as indicated in the diamond - shaped block b of the flow chart. the decision of the diamond - shaped block c of the flow chart is carried out by decision circuit 72. the decision specified in diamond - shaped block d of the flow chart is performed by decision circuit 73 and the decision set forth in diamond - shaped block e is carried out by

in the diamond - shaped block g of the flow chart is carried out by jk flip - flop 78, exclusive - or gate 79, full adder 80, d - type flip - flop 81, decision circuits 82 and 83 and and gate 84. the decision set forth in diamond - shaped block h of the flow chart is carried out by d - type flip - flops 85 and 86, serial adders including d - type flip - flops 87 and 88 and full adders 89 and 90, decision circuits 91 and 92, and gate 93, inhibit gate 94, or gate 95 and not gate 95 & # 39 ;. the decision specified in the diamond - shaped block i of the flow chart is carried out by the full adder including d - type flip - flop 96 and full adder 97, decision circuit 98, and gate 99, inhibit gate 100, and gate 101 receiving inputs from the flow logic of fig8 j and or gate 102. the decision indicated in the diamond - shaped block j of the flow chart is carried out by decision circuits 103 - 106, or gates 107 and 108, multiplexer 109 receiving selection inputs from the flow logic of fig8 j and not gate 110. the decision set forth in the diamond - shaped block k of the flow chart is performed by d - type flip - flops 111 - 113, jk flip - flop 114, exclusive - or gate 115, serial adder including d - type flip - flop 116 and full adder 117, decision circuits 118 and 119, or gate 120, not gate 121 and and gates 121a and 121b. the decision set forth in the diamond - shaped block l of the flow chart is provided by d - type flip - flop 122 operating on the v / uv input to the pitch period analyzer. a 13th decision identified as d13 is provided by jk flip - flop 123, exclusive - or gate 124, the serial adder including d - type flip - flop 125, and full adder 126 and d - type flip - flop 127. this decision signal is sent to multiplexers 128 and 129 whose outputs are coupled to jk flip - flop 130, exclusive - or gate 131 and two serial adders, one of which includes d - type flip - flop 132 and full adder 133 and the other of which includes d - type flip - flop 134 and full adder 135. the output of full adder 135 is coupled to one of the signal inputs of multiplexer 52 which provides a dlper output which cooperates in providing the decision in diamond - shaped block g of the flow chart. thus, the 13th decision d13 is used to control the production of 7th decision signal g - d7 and e - d7. while we have described above the principles of our invention in connection with specific apparatus it is to be clearly understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of our invention as set forth in the objects thereof and in

"the basic matters of the one - dimensional ion trap according to this invention are explained with reference to a first embodiment. a second embodiment deals with the form of operation using the one - dimensional ion trap according to this invention as a mass spectrometric analysis means. in a third embodiment, the form of operation using the one - dimensional ion trap according to this invention as an ion mobility means is explained. this embodiment deals with the basic matters of the one - dimensional ion trap including a solid - cylindrical electrode ( inner electrode ) formed of a solid cylinder and a hollow - cylindrical electrode ( outer electrode ) formed of a hollow cylinder. the electrode structure includes the hollow - cylindrical electrode 1 ( radius : r 2 ) and the solid - cylindrical electrode ( radius : r 1 ) arranged on the same axis. a radio frequency voltage ( amplitude vrf, frequency / 2 ) is applied to the solid - cylindrical electrode using a radio frequency voltage power supply 3, where the dc bias of the rf voltage should be zero, while a dc voltage ( udc ) is applied to the hollow - cylindrical electrode using a dc voltage power supply 4, where the rf voltage of the dc voltage should be zero. the aforementioned arrangement in terms of voltage is shown in fig1. first, the motion of ions with the electrode arrangement and voltage described above is theoretically described. the potential formed between the two electrodes is dependent on the distance r from the center axis and given by the equation below. upon application of this potential, the potential for generating the force acting on ions in time average is given as the calculation of this equation employs the pseudo - potential method generally used in the radio frequency ion trap theory. this equation is formed of two parts on the right side including the first term representing the pseudo - potential due to the radio frequency and the second term the potential due to the electrostatic voltage. this is illustrated in fig2. specifically, the pseudo - potential applies the outward force from the center axis to the ions and has no effect on the polarity of the ions. the electrostatic voltage, on the other hand, is adapted to apply the force toward the center axis to the ions. the dc voltage udc is positive in the case where positive ions are trapped, and negative in the case where negative ions are trapped. the potential equal to the sum of the two potentials, i. e. the potential given by equation ( 2 ) is also shown in fig2. as understood from fig2, the potential of the one - dimensional ion trap according to this invention has a local minimum value, and from equation ( 2 ), the position assuming the particular local minimum value is given by equation ( 3 ) below. in order to obtain the local minimum value, the polarity of udc is of course required to be determined with respect to the polarity of ions as described above. from equation ( 3 ), it is understood that ions having a large m / z value are located inside near the center axis and ions having a small m / z value outside far from the center axis. in this way, with the one - dimensional ion trap according to this embodiment, it is understood that ions having different m / z values are trapped cylindrically at different radii. for this reason, this method is called the one - dimensional trap. the range of m / z value in which ions can be trapped is determined by the values of the radio frequency voltage and the electrostatic voltage. in other words, ions that can be trapped have a stable area unique thereto. this fact is derived from the condition that there must exist a stable point of ions given by equation ( 3 ) between inner and outer electrodes ; otherwise, ions would bombard the electrodes. specifically, the relation holds that the condition that the solid - cylindrical electrode is not bombarded by ions leads to equation ( 5 ). also, the condition that the hollow - cylindrical electrode is not bombarded by ions leads to equation ( 6 ). the ions existing within the area determined by these two values are actually trapped. based on this principle, an explanation is made in more detail according to the actual electrode size and voltage condition. the values described below are used as representative parameters to be substituted. using these values of the device parameters, the value m / z = 13 - 1325 is obtained as a range of the mass in which ions can be trapped. this ion trap is considered applicable to various environmental pollution substances, illegal drugs and hazardous objects. in these applications, however, the valence number z of ions often assumes unity, and therefore, ions having the molecular weight of about 13 to 1300 can be trapped. this range covers the molecular weight of all the molecules to be detected in these applications. the ion trapping process along the direction of the center axis is explained. as described in summary of the invention above, this invention discloses two means for trapping ions in the direction along the center axis. ( 1 ) disk - shaped wall electrodes are arranged at the two ends and the ion leakage is prevented by applying a dc voltage ( fig3 a ) ( 2 ) wall electrodes conducting with the hollow - cylindrical electrode are added to short the electrode ends. as a result, the rf voltage is deformed, and an ion converging force is generated as a pseudo - potential ( fig3 b ). according to the means ( 1 ) above, ions are trapped by applying a dc electric field to the wall electrodes by a dc voltage. in the means ( 2 ), on the other hand, the electromagnetic wave due to rf can be prevented from leaking out of the electrodes, and as compared with the means ( 1 ), the number of parts is reduced, thereby providing a method that can be implemented at low cost. fig4 a and 4b show the potential determined by numerically calculating the potential applied in the form of the electrode shown in fig3 b and calculating the pseudo - potential as in equation ( 2 ). the potential depth is indicated by the color density so that the color higher in density indicates a deep potential and the color lower in density a low potential. the calculation uses the representative device parameters described above. it is understood from fig4 a that the bottom of the potential is separated from the end portion and that the potential for trapping ions is formed also in the direction of the center axis. it has been found, however, that with the decrease in m / z, the bottom of the potential is formed on the electrode and ions are lost as shown in fig4 b. this indicates that with the decrease in m / z, the outward potential due to radio frequency is increased and overcomes the inward force due to the electrostatic voltage, resulting in the loss of ions. especially at the corner making up the bottom of the potential, the electric field is weak and the effect is great. after all, it has been found that this method can trap ions in the direction along the center axis but the mass area is somewhat reduced on the low mass side. this reduction, however, is very small and the effect thereof is considered substantially ignorable in application. to summarize, the method according to this embodiment has the great features described below. ( 1 ) ions are converged on the surface of a cylinder having the radius given by equation ( 3 ). in the conventional three - dimensional trap ( what is called the paul trap ), on the other hand, ions are converged at one point. also, in the conventional two - dimensional trap ( what is called the linear ion trap ), ions are converged on a straight line. ( 2 ) ions different in m / z are converged on the surfaces of cylinders different in radius. according to the paul trap, on the other hand, ions having different m / z values are converged at the same point. also, in the conventional linear ion trap, ions having different m / z values are converged on the same straight line. these two features of the one - dimensional trap according to this invention makes it possible to reduce the mutual interaction between a plurality of ions and the spatial charge effect, as compared with the conventional methods, in an application to the mass spectrometry as described in the second embodiment. sample ions are most simply introduced from a hole formed in the hollow - cylindrical electrode. the ion trap according to this embodiment can be set to the vacuum degree of 1 torr ( 0. 01 pa ) which can be easily realized by what is called the roughing vacuum pump ( the low vacuum pump such as the rotary pump or the diaphragm pump, the turbo molecular pump for realizing a high vacuum may not be used ). in this case, the relation between vacuum degree and viscous resistance is such that the value of a typical ion mobility k is 0. 8 to 2. 4 cm 2 / v / sec ( for 14 to 500 amu @ ambient pressure ). fig5 shows the result of calculating the trajectory of ions introduced from the hollow - cylindrical electrode under the conditions specified by ion mobility spectrometry, g. a. eicemann & amp ; z. karpas, crc press. 2005. in fig5, ( 1 ) designates a case in which m / z is 20, ( 2 ) a case in which m / z is 200, ( 3 ) a case in which m / z is 1000, and ( 4 ) a case in which m / z is 1500. with the ion trajectory in equilibrium, the radius at which ions are located is equal to the value given by equation ( 3 ). in the case of ( 4 ) above, however, the conditions are unstable, and therefore, ions are lost by bombarding the electrodes. according to this calculation, ions are introduced at the rate of not more than 1 ms. specifically, according to this method, ions are settled in about 1 ms, and therefore, a high - speed operation is made possible. incidentally, the trajectory for m / z = 20 appears thick due to the forced vibration ( what is called the micromotion ) caused by radio frequency. a large micromotion blurs the position of ions and has an adverse effect on the mass resolution in mass spectrometry applications. the micromotion can be effectively reduced by increasing the radio frequency and reducing the value udc. according to this embodiment, the frequency of not lower than 2 mhz is determined as a proper value. ions can be introduced still faster by increasing vrf and udc and thus deepening the potential not to change the stable ion position. as seen from equations ( 3 ), ( 5 ) and ( 6 ), the shape of the potential remains unchanged by holding the relation vrf 2 udc. incidentally, ions having a specified m / z can also be isolated by use of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in the one - dimensional ion trap according to this embodiment. specifically, in accordance with the m / z value of target ions, the radio frequency voltage or the electrostatic voltage is changed thereby to approach the stability boundary m 1 ( heavy side ) or m 2 ( light side ). with the approach to m 1, a large m / z value is excluded, while the approach to m 2 eliminates ions having a small m / z value. although the two stability boundaries cannot be approached at the same time, ions can be isolated by combining the two operations. the isolation resolution can be determined by the degree to which the m / z value of the target ions can approach a stability boundary. an application of the one - dimensional ion trap as an analysis means is described. this application is based on the principle defined by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) for determining a stable area according to the first embodiment. specifically, the instability in the trap conditions is utilized as a mass spectrometric analysis method. as described in summary of the invention above, stable ions trapped are instabilized ( i. e. instabilized in mass selectivity ) by controlling and changing the voltage condition, and the electron current generated by bombarding the electrode is measured by the ampere meter. in this way, the m / z value and the quantity of the trapped ions are measured. this operation has the feature that the mass spectrometry conducted using the static stability conditions of ions makes possible the analysis independent of the gas pressure. specifically, the operation is possible in low vacuum. the term low vacuum is generally defined as about 1 to 10 6 torr, while the term high vacuum about 10 6 to 10 8 torr. in the conventional method of mass spectrometric analysis operation, the resonance vibration of ions is utilized, and therefore, the bombardment of the gas has so large an effect on the resolution that the low - vacuum operation is impossible and a high vacuum is required. for carrying out the mass spectrometry using the one - dimensional ion trap according to this embodiment, two ion detection methods described below are available. ( a ) the ion current is measured by mass selective bombardment of ions against the solid - cylindrical electrode. ( b ) the ion current is measured by mass selective bombardment of ions against the hollow - cylindrical electrode. also, for carrying out the mass spectrometry using the one - dimensional ion trap according to this embodiment, three mass selective scanning methods described below are available. from these choices, six combinations are basically conceivable, and the superiority of any one of them over the others can be determined using the degree of the mass resolution as an index. according to this embodiment, the combinations of ( a ), ( b ) with ( 1 ) ( 2 ) are studied below. the parameters described above are used for calculations. in the case of ( 3 ), the mass selective scanning is made possible by scanning the frequency of the digital wave while maintaining a constant amplitude. as to the criterion for superiority, a high mass resolution can be most easily achieved in the case where a linear result is obtained on a graph plotting a variable parameter along the abscissa and the mass at the stability - instability boundary along the ordinate. thus, a case producing a substantially linear relation is selected. the calculation result is shown in fig6 a and 6b. fig6 a shows the calculation result in the case where ions are detected by scanning the radio frequency amplitude. the line designated by a 1 indicates the m / z value with ions bombarding the solid - cylindrical electrode 2 and the line designated by a 2 the m / z value with ions bombarding the hollow - cylindrical electrode 1. the ions existing in the area defined by the two lines are stably trapped, while ions existing in other than this stable area bombard the solid - cylindrical electrode or the hollow - cylindrical electrode and fail to be trapped in stable condition. also, fig6 b shows the calculation result in the case where the electrostatic voltage is scanned to detect ions. the line designated by b 1 represents the m / z value with ions bombarding the solid - cylindrical electrode 2 and the line designated by b 2 the m / z value with ions bombarding the hollow - cylindrical electrode 1. the ions existing in the area defined by the two lines are stably trapped, while the ions existing in other than this stable area bombard the solid - cylindrical electrode or the hollow - cylindrical electrode and fail to be trapped in stable condition. as indicated by line a 1, the calculation result for a method to detect the ion current with the solid - cylindrical electrode ( inner electrode ) while scanning the radio frequency amplitude due to this line is substantially linear and considered easy to detect. the mass spectrometric analysis operation is basically possible also by other methods. line a 2 represents a case in which the radio frequency amplitude is scanned to detect ions with the hollow - cylindrical electrode ( outer electrode ). the case is also applicable, though narrow in the mass range in which instability increases with respect to the scanning amount of the radio frequency amplitude. line b 1 represents a case in which the dc voltage is scanned to detect ions on the solid - cylindrical electrode. in this case, though applicable for detection, a slight voltage change in the high mass area greatly changes an unstable area, and therefore, a high resolution cannot be easily achieved with a high mass. further, line b 2 represents a case in which the dc voltage is scanned and the ion current is detected on the hollow - cylindrical electrode. also this case, though difficult to achieve a high resolution, is applicable in spite of the fact that a slight parameter change results in a great change in unstable mass. as described above, all the operation methods can basically produce a mass spectrum. from the viewpoint of the ease with which a resolution is easily secured, however, the method indicated by line a 1 in which the radio frequency amplitude is scanned and ions are detected on the solid - cylindrical electrode ( inner electrode ) is considered the best embodiment. also, the method indicated by line b 1 in which the electrostatic voltage is scanned to detect ions on the solid - cylindrical electrode ( inner electrode ) is considered the next best embodiment. a system configuration for embodying the principle described above is shown in fig7. the ion trap portion includes a hollow - cylindrical electrode 1, a solid - cylindrical electrode 2, insulating members 7, 8 for isolating the two electrodes from each other and supporting the solid - cylindrical electrode 2, a vacuum bath 9 for accommodating these trap electrodes, a vacuum pump 10, an ion source 11 and a pipe 12 for introducing the ions generated in the ion source to the vacuum bath. the radio frequency power supply 3 shown in fig1 includes such elements as a oscillator 15, a multiplier 17, a radio frequency amplifier 18, a step - up radio frequency transformer 19, a rf amplitude monitor circuit 20, capacitors 21, 22 and a feedback amplifier 16. the current monitor circuit includes a current amplifier 23. the radio frequency amplitude and the electrostatic voltage are controlled and the current value read by a digital / analog converter 14 controlled by a computer 13. incidentally, the vacuum pump 10 is a diaphragm pump. now, the circuit parts are explained. the radio frequency amplitude control voltage generated by the converter 14 in response to a command from the computer 13 is multiplied by the signal of the oscillator 15 through the feedback amplifier 16, and the amplitude - controlled radio frequency signal is input to the radio frequency amplifier 18. the power - amplified radio frequency signal is further amplified by the transformer 19 and input to the solid - cylindrical electrode 2. the amplitude of the voltage at the output end of the transformer 19 is converted into a low electrostatic voltage and input to the feedback amplifier 16. this circuit, makings up a negative feedback circuit, is controlled in such a manner that the output voltage of the transformer 19 is always proportional to the control voltage output from the converter 14. incidentally, the output signal of the oscillator 15 may assume a rectangular wave or, more preferably, a sinusoidal wave. this is by reason of the fact that the transformer 19 and the ion trap electrode make up a resonance circuit and only the resonant sinusoidal wave component is amplified, so that the voltage applied to the ion trap actually assumes a sinusoidal wave. the voltage generated by the converter 14 is input as an electrostatic voltage to the hollow - cylindrical electrode 1. in the process, the transformer 19 is connected using the capacitors 21, 22 so that the radio frequency power may not pass through the converter 14, while at the same time inserting an electric resistance ( about 1 m ) connected with the converter 14 as required. as a result, the radio frequency power locally exists between the transformer and the trap electrode. the ion current follows the route from the solid - cylindrical electrode 2 through the transformer to the current amplifier 23. the output of the current amplifier is analyzed by the computer through the converter 14. the a 1 mode described above is most preferable as an analysis process. the radio frequency amplitude is set to a value as large as about 200 v and the ions generated by the ion source are trapped. about one millisecond later, the ions enter an equilibrium state, and therefore, the radio frequency amplitude is scanned downward. then, the outward force due to the radio frequency is reduced and the ions move toward the center. once the ions bombard the electrode, the ion quantity is detected as an ion current. as described above, by measuring the ion current with respect to the radio frequency amplitude, a mass spectrum can be obtained. the radio frequency amplitude is converted to the m / z value of ions according to equation ( 3 ). an application of the invention to an ion mobility analysis means is explained. a system configuration is similar to that of the second embodiment. first, the mass analysis operation ( second embodiment ) is performed to determine the m / z value of target ions. then, the ion species is isolated by the method described in the first embodiment. the isolated ions are set to a high voltage at a radio frequency amplitude to locate it in the neighborhood of the outside of the ion trap to lengthen the drift distance. then, the voltage vrf is turned off instantaneously, and ions having a large ion mobility k bombard the solid - cylindrical electrode before the remaining ions. the time difference between the time during which the radio frequency is turned off and the time when the ion current is measured indicates the ion mobility. by using this operation, the two - dimensional measurement of the mass - to - charge ratio and the ion mobility of the specimen ions is made possible. also, the ion mobility can be measured by detecting the current on the hollow - cylindrical electrode with the electrostatic voltage instantaneously turned off. fig8 shows two calculation results for 50 % different values of the ion mobility k. in this case, the ion m / z value is 200 and the electrostatic voltage of 1 v is applied. the trajectory shown in ( 1 ) is 50 % larger in ion mobility than the trajectory shown in ( 2 ). in this way, the time before reaching the surface of the solid - cylindrical electrode ( indicated by dotted line ) is varied with k, and therefore, ions different in mobility in spite of the same m / z value can be distinguished. it should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.","a mass spectrometer using a one - dimensional ion trap is disclosed . the mass spectrometer having the one - dimensional ion trap can trap a great amount of ions , and the provision of a mass spectrometric analyzer capable of operation in a low vacuum eliminates the need of a high vacuum ."

[ 0017 ] fig4 is a flow chart explaining the operations related to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. operation of the display is started when the main switch 101 is operated. it is determined at step si whether or not the main switch 101 is turned on. if the main switch 101 is on, the cpu 102, at step s 2, directs a count of the frame of film to be photographed to be displayed at the multiple section display 1, thereby displaying the state shown in fig3. if it is determined at step s 1 that the main switch 101 is off, the cpu 102, at step s 3, directs a date to be displayed in the multiple section display 1, thereby displaying the state shown in fig2. if the photographic film count is displayed on the left or right side of the multiple section display 1, it may be difficult to see the count from a diagonal direction. consequently, if the photographic film count is displayed in the center of the multiple section display 1, as in the preferred embodiment of the present invention and shown in fig3 the photographic film count is easy to see. in this embodiment of the present invention, since the photographic film count is displayed in the center of the multiple section display 1 which is comprised of at least three two - digit segments, the count is extremely easy to see. as described above, according to the present invention, a single display for separately displaying a date and a photographic film count is effective even as the liquid crystal becomes smaller, thereby reducing cost. also, since the photographic film count display is easy to see, the operability of the camera is improved. although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.",a display device for a camera including a multiple section display that displays data arranged in a specified direction . a control unit controls the multiple section display to display date data or a count of the frames of film . the count of the frames of film is displayed in the center of the multiple section display so that it is easy to see .
"detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. it is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner. turning first to fig1 there is shown a basic cell whose 12 exterior vertices are all equidistant from the center node. for the remainder of the description, the basic cell in fig1 is called the ve cell ( or just the ve ). turning now to fig2 there is shown a sample version of an isotropic vector matrix, which is built upon the basic ve cell. to accomplish an important function of this invention, there is shown in fig3 the six basis vectors of the ve cell : e 1 - e 6. for definitiveness, the six basis vectors in fig3 are now expressed in cartesian coordinates ( in accordance with the cartesian orientation shown in fig1 ) : e 3 = a x ( 1 / 2 { square root } 3 ) a y ( 1 / 2 ) + a z ( { square root } 2 / { square root } 3 ), e 4 = a x ( 1 / { square root } 3 ) + a z ( { square root } 2 / { square root } 3 ), e 5 = a x ( 1 / 2 { square root } 3 ) + a y ( 1 / 2 ) + a z ( { square root } 2 / { square root } 3 ), note that the basis vectors e 1 - e 6 have unit length as do the standard cartesian unit vectors a x - a z. also know that ( from inspection ) : the basic ve cell has twelve vertices around the center node. we can use a six - tuple to reference all of these aforementioned twelve points, with each element of the tuple representing a displacement in the corresponding unit vector direction. the center of the ve cell will be designated to have an address of ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ), and the vertice designated with the address ( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) represents the point at the tip of the basis vector e 1. a shorthand notation for the vertice at ( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) is ( + 1 ). that is, we will use ( 6 ) to represent the vertice at ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ). we now describe a method to construct the vector calculus curl operator on the ve cell. for the development of this finite - difference style evaluation of the curl within the ve, we use two vector s and t, which are related by the equation s = t, which is to be evaluated at s ( 0 ), which requires values of the vector t at t ( + 1 ), t ( 1 ), t ( + 2 ), t ( 2 ), t ( + 3 ), t ( 3 ), t ( + 4 ), t ( 4 ), t ( + 5 ), t ( 5 ), t ( + 6 ), and t ( 6 ). that is, we use the value of t at all twelve exterior points of the ve cell to obtain an approximation of s at the center of the ve cell. moreover, the vectors s and t will be written is terms of the ve basis vectors ; that is : s = s 1 e 1 + s 2 e 2 + s 3 e 3 + s 4 e 4 + s 5 e 5 + s 6 e 6, t = t 1 e 1 + t 2 e 2 + t 3 e 3 + t 4 e 4 + t 5 e 5 + t 6 e 6. within the framework of the ve cell, we want to evaluate s = t, which is defined ( as shown in any advanced vector calculus text ) as where da is the area enclosed by the contour of integration, and n is the unit vector is the direction which makes the right - hand side of the equation takes on its maximum value. the contour integral in the definition is commonly called the circulation ; which is a term that will be used in the remainder of this description. to accomplish an important aspect of the invention, we will evaluate contours around the four hexagonal planes of the ve cell. the four hexagonal planes of the ve cell are labeled the a - plane, the b - plane, the c - plane, and the d - plane. the aforementioned contours on the four hexagonal planes of the ve cell include only the exterior points of the ve cell, with each plane containing a unique set of six points. the exterior vertices on each of the hexagonal planes that make up the four contours are ( with the vertices in this order ) : for each of the four contours to be evaluated, note that the lefthand side of the curl involves three components of the s vector in the ve basis. we now evaluate the circulation around the a - plane that is shown in fig4 and take the dot product of the result against the unit vector normal to the a - plane, n a ( = a z in this case ). thus ( s 3 e 3 + s 4 e 4 + s 5 e 5 ) n a = ( 1 / da ) [ t dl ] a. e 3 n a = e 4 n a = e 5 n a = ( { square root } 2 / { square root } 3 ), ( s 3 + s 4 + s 5 ) = ( 3 / 2 ) ( 1 / d a ) [ t d l ] a, = a, which defines the variable a. that is, a = ( { square root } 3 / { square root } 2 ) ( 1 / da ) t dl ] a. the evaluation of a, as it involves standard vector calculus techniques available in the literature, will not be discussed herein. the evaluation of the contour around the b - plane that is shown in fig5 results in the following equation : where b = ( { square root } 3 / { square root } 2 ) ( 1 / da ) t dl ] b. the evaluation of the contour around the c - plane that is shown in fig6 results in the following equation : where c = ( { square root } 3 / { square root } 2 ) ( 1 / da ) t dl ] c. the evaluation of the contour around the d - plane that is shown in fig7 results in the following equation : where d = ( { square root } 3 / { square root } 2 ) ( 1 / da ) t dl ] d. evidently, as the equations from the four contours show, in accordance with an important part of the invention, the values for the components of the resulting s vector can now be written : which describes how to discretely approximate the vector calculus curl function on a ve cell, and within an associated isotropic vector matrix. in fig8 is shown the evaluation of the s 3 component of s which involves the a and b contours. the divergence of a vector field and the gradient can also be derived within the framework of this isotropic vector field decomposition method. while the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form set forth, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","an isotropic vector field decomposition method for use in scientific computations with the steps of : a computational grid modeled on a specific arrangement of nodes , such that each node is equidistant from it &# 39 ;

"embodiments of the present invention will be described below, referring to fig1 to 13. in the following description, components having the same functions and structures are labeled with the same reference signs and redundant description is omitted. the best mode of the present invention is described below as a first example of the present invention, referring to fig1 to 6 and fig1. fig1 is a diagram showing an entire magnetic resonance imaging device of the present invention, and is an exemplary structure diagram of an mri device having a portable table 400 which can be attached to and detached from a gantry 100. as shown in fig1, the gantry 100 of the mri device in the present invention includes a magnet 101 which generates a static magnetic field, a gradient magnetic field generation coil 102 which generates a gradient magnetic field, and a high frequency transmitter coil 103 which generates a high frequency magnetic field. the portable table 400 which can be attached to and detached from the gantry 100 by docking connectors 501 and 502 includes a table top 401 which can move in z - axis direction on a frame 402, and wired composite cable wiring 403. on or in the table top 401, an rf coil 300 is provided. a subject 104 is placed on the rf coil 300, and is arranged in the magnet 101 and the gradient magnetic field generation coil 102 by movement of the table top in z - axis direction. the rf coil 300 is provided with a coil connector 300 c. the coil connector 300 c is connected to a table top connector 410 connected to a composite cable in the table top 401, when the rf coil is placed. in general, the gradient magnetic field generation coil 102 is formed by three - axis gradient magnetic field coils of which three axes are perpendicular to one another. moreover, a sequencer 110 sends a command to a gradient magnetic field power source 107 and a high frequency magnetic field generator 106 to generate a gradient magnetic field and an rf pulse from the gradient magnetic field coil 102 and the high frequency transmitter coil 103, respectively. the high frequency magnetic field generator 106 is usually formed by an rf pulse generator and a power amplifier which amplifies the rf pulse. the amplified rf pulse output is applied to the subject 104 via the high frequency transmitter coil 103 at a timing in accordance with the command from the sequencer 110. the gradient magnetic field power source 107 also applies a gradient magnetic field to the subject 104 from the respective three - axis gradient magnetic field coils at a timing in accordance with the command from the sequencer 110. a magnetic resonance signal generated from the subject 104 is received by the rf coil 300, is amplified in a preamplifier ( not shown here ) in the rf coil, and is then transmitted to a receiver 105 via the coil connector 300 c, the table top connector 410, the cable wiring 403, and the docking connectors 501 and 502. in the receiver 105, appropriate signal processing is performed, a / d conversion ( sampling ) is performed, and then signal detection is performed. the detected signal is sent to a calculation portion 111, and is subjected to sampling processing there. then, digital signal processing such as image reconstruction is performed and the result is displayed on a display portion 109. digital data or a measurement condition can be stored in a storage medium 108 as needed. the sequencer 110 performs controls in accordance with the measurement condition stored in the storage medium 108 and / or a command received from the calculation portion 111 so that respective devices operate at programmed timings with programmed intensities. among the programs, those that describe timings of application of the rf pulse, application of the gradient magnetic field, and reception of a nuclear magnetic resonance signal and intensities of the rf pulse and the gradient magnetic field are especially referred to as an imaging sequence. a circuit in the rf coil 300 controlled by the imaging sequence is described by using fig1. fig1 illustrates only one of a plurality of channels, and shows a coil element 300 a provided in the rf coil ( used as a reception coil here ), a signal detection portion 300 b, a trap circuit 300 e, a reception cable 300 d, the coil connector 300 c, the table top connector 410 and the docking connector 501 provided in the table top 401, the docking connector 502 provided in the gantry 100, the receiver 105, and an a / d signal processor 105 a which is in charge of one channel among a / d signal processors respectively provided for a plurality of channels in the receiver 105. in the signal detection portion 300 b, a matching circuit and a preamplifier 701 are provided, and a power supply cable 702 for receiving power supply is connected to the preamplifier 701. the trap circuit 300 e is formed by a capacitor 703, an inductor 704, and a diode 705. at both ends of the diode 705, a current supply cable 706 for supplying a diode driving current is connected. on the other hand, a table top control portion 200 has functions of controlling movement of the table top of the portable table and identifying the type of the coil connected to the table top, and is also provided with a current supply source 200 a and a preamplifier driving power source 200 b. the current supply source 200 a and the preamplifier driving power source 200 b are connected to the current supply cable 706 and the power supply cable 702, respectively, and, as needed, are assembled into one cable together with the reception cable 300 d via a relay board within the receiver 105 such that that cable is connected as the composite cable wiring 403 to the diode 705 and the preamplifier 701 via the coil connector 300 c, the table top connector 410, and the docking connectors 501 and 502. the preamplifier 701 operates by the preamplifier driving power source 200 b and receives a nuclear magnetic resonance signal in accordance with the reception timing of the imaging sequence. the reception cable 300 d amplifies the nuclear magnetic resonance signal received by the coil element 300 a with the preamplifier 701 in the signal detection portion 300 b and transmits it to the a / d signal processor 105 a via the coil connector 300 c, the table top connector 410, and the docking connectors 501 and 502. in the trap circuit 300 e, the diode 705 is driven by the current supply source 200 a such that, when the diode is turned on, a resonance circuit formed by the capacitor 701 and the inductor 704 resonates in series, the impedance seen from both ends of the capacitor 703 toward the coil element 300 a side becomes large, and the resonance frequency of the coil element 300 a largely shifts from the resonance frequency of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal. on the other hand, when the diode is turned off, the trap circuit is not established and the resonance frequency of the coil element 300 a is coincident with that of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal, so that the coil element 300 a operates as the rf coil. with the above - described structure, the table top control portion 200 controls the current supply source 200 a and the preamplifier driving power source 200 b in accordance with the command from the sequencer 110. especially in a case where the rf coil 300 is used as the reception coil, the table top control portion 200 controls turning on and off of the diode 705 in the trap circuit 300 c in synchronization with the application timing of the rf pulse and the reception timing of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal that are in accordance with the imaging sequence for preventing electromagnetic coupling with the transmitter coil 103. for turning an operation for receiving a nuclear magnetic resonance signal from a coil element located outside a desired imaging range off, the power source 200 a for the diode 705 in the trap circuit 300 c may be turned on or the preamplifier power source 200 b may be turned off. although only a case where the rf coil 300 is the reception coil is described here, in a case where the rf coil 300 is an irradiation coil, this can be applied to the irradiation coil when a transmission / reception switching circuit is inserted between the signal detection portion 300 b and 300 a, the current supply cable 706 is connected to the transmission / reception switching circuit, and the table top control portion 200 controls the transmission / reception switching circuit. in this case, the trap circuit 300 e is not required. fig2 are appearance views of the mri device having the portable table 400 which can be attached to and detached from the gantry 100, one of which is a view showing coil installation in a case of head first mode where the table top 401 moves such that a subject ( not shown ) enters into the gantry 100 from the head side, and the other of which is a view showing coil installation in a case of feet first mode where the table top 401 moves such that a subject ( not shown ) enters into the gantry 100 from the feet side. the portable table 400 and the gantry 100 are attached to and detached from each other by connection and separation of the docking connectors 501 and 502. considering the attachability / detachability and the material cost of the portable table 400 and a wiring process of the cable wiring 403 within the table, it is desirable that the docking connector 501 be provided at only one position on a certain surface of the table top 401 or the frame 402. therefore, in the rf coil 300, each of two or more rf coil units ( divided into a first rf coil unit 301, a second rf coil unit 302, a third rf coil unit 303, and a fourth rf coil unit 304 here ) has an independent coil connector ( not shown here ), is connected to the table top connector ( not shown here ) on the table top 401, and is placed on the table top 401. please note that the first rf coil unit 301 is an rf coil unit having sensitivity at the head portion of the subject. in a case of head first mode, the first rf coil unit 301 is arranged on the table top 401 on the side closer to the gantry 101. in a case of feet first mode, the first rf coil unit 301 is arranged on the table top 401 on the side farther from the gantry 101. thus, it is possible to provide the docking connector 501 provided in the portable table, at only one position on a certain surface of the table top 401 or the frame 402. fig3 is a diagram showing the rf coil 300 and the table top 401 of the present invention. fig3 is a side view in a case where the rf coil 300 is divided into a plurality of rf coil units ( the first rf coil unit 301, the second rf coil unit 302, and the third rf coil unit 303 ) by dividing portions of the housings ( positions shown with 312 and 323 ) as described above, and those are placed on the table top 401. the respective rf coil units are installed such that end portions overlap each other as shown as overlapped portions 312 and 323. the reason why the end portions are arranged to overlap each other is described here. when the distance between two coil elements is relatively large, electromagnetic coupling between the two coil elements can be reduced to a level of practically no problem. however, in a case where the loop dimension of the coil element is large relative to the distance between the two coil elements, magnetic coupling between the coil elements can be removed by appropriately overlapping the adjacent two coil elements ( in about 10 % of the area ). as shown in fig3, by overlapping the end portions of the adjacent coil units, the coil elements in the adjacent coil units can always overlap each other in the constant area, so that magnetic coupling between the coil elements can be removed. the third rf coil unit 303 is placed at an approximately center portion ( i. e., in a portion close to the waist of a subject ) in the longitudinal direction of the table top 401, the second rf coil unit 302 is placed next to the third rf coil unit 303, and the first rf coil unit 301 is placed next to the second rf coil unit 302. while the adjacent rf coil units are arranged to overlap each other in the end portions thereof, the overlapped portions 323 and 312 are formed so that the end portion of the rf coil unit closer to the center portion is arranged on the lower side. thus, the first rf coil unit 301 ( rf coil for the head portion ), that is the most frequently attached and detached, is formed such that it is always arranged on the upper side in the overlapped portion. the second rf coil unit 302, that is attached and detached relatively less frequently, is formed such that the end portion is arranged on the lower side in the overlapped portion 312 and is arranged on the upper side in the overlapped portion 323. the rf coil unit 303 ( rf coil arranged at a position around the waist portion of a subject and used for imaging from the abdomen to the thighs ) is arranged at the most closest position to the center portion of the table top 401, and is formed such that the end portion thereof is always on the lower side as in the overlapped portion 323. the third rf coil unit 303 is an rf coil unit for a portion around the waist, and the position of the third rf coil unit 303 is considered to be almost the same both in a case of head - first mode and a case of feet - first mode. therefore, the third rf coil unit 303 is characteristic that it is the least frequently attached and detached. moreover, the rf coil unit 303 may be fixed and connected to the table top in some cases, instead of being attachable / detachable. in addition, the third rf coil unit 303 is formed such that the end portion thereof which is to overlap the fourth rf coil unit 304 shown in fig2 or the second rf coil unit 302 in feet - first mode ( i. e., the farther end portion from the gantry ) is also arranged on the lower side. furthermore, the respective rf coil units are arranged with no electric connection therebetween. as described above, since the rf coil unit 301 for the head portion is considered to be the most frequently attached and detached, the shape of the stepped portion of the dividing portion of the rf coil unit for the head portion has a projection on the farther side from the table top so that the overlapping portion of the rf coil unit for the head portion is arranged at the uppermost level. on the other hand, in the rf coil for the portion around the waist, the shape of the stepped portion in the dividing portion projects on the closer side to the table top so that the overlapping portion of that rf coil unit is located at the bottom. the shape of the dividing portion may be stepped as shown in fig3 or inclined. in a case where it is stepped, the coil unit can be stably fixed. also, by modifying the projection of the stepped portion as described above, the coil unit which is more frequently attached and detached can be arranged at an upper level, thereby allowing easy attachment and detachment. fig4 shows an internal structure of fig3. the first rf coil unit 301, the second rf coil unit 302, and the third rf coil unit 303 have a first coil element 301 a, a second coil element 302 a, a third coil element 303 a ; a first feed point 301 b, a second feed point 302 b, and a third feed point 303 b ; and a first coil connector 301 c, a second coil connector 302 c, and a third coil connector 303 c in housings 301 d, 302 d, and 303 d, respectively, which are connected in a high - frequency manner. the coil elements in the adjacent units ( 301 a and 302 a, and 302 a and 303 a in fig4 ) overlap each other at least partly. the respective housings 301 d to 303 d are boxes each accommodating the coil element ( 301 a to 303 a ) and the feed point ( 301 b to 303 b ) and separate the rf coil at respective dividing portions ( 312 and 323 ), as shown in the drawing. the housing dividing portions ( 312 and 323 ) are provided between the coil elements of the adjacent units, that is, are provided so as not to cut the coil elements and so as to avoid the coil elements. the feed point is a circuit which is connected to each coil element to detect a high frequency signal received by that coil element. moreover, the dividing portion is a portion of the housing which overlaps the housing of the adjacent unit. by the dividing portions, the rf coil 300 is divided into a plurality of units. the table top 401 includes a first table top connector 411, a second table top connector 412, and a third table top connector 413. the respective table top connectors are connected to the docking connector 501 via the cable wiring 403. when the respective divided rf coil units are installed on the table top, the coil connector 303 c is connected to the table top connector 413, the coil connector 302 c is connected to the table top connector 412, and the coil connector 301 c is connected to the table top connector 411. for example, in a case where the rf coil 300 is a reception coil, a magnetic resonance signal is received by the coil elements 301 a, 302 a, and 303 a and is detected by the feed points 301 b, 302 b, and 303 b. the detected signals are transmitted to the docking connector 501 through the respective coil connectors 301 c, 302 c, and 303 c and the table top connectors 411, 412, and 413, and further through the cable wiring 403. in fig4, in the overlapped portions 312 and 323, the coil elements 301 a and 302 a spatially overlap each other and the coil elements 302 a and 303 a spatially overlap each other. the respective rf coil units are arranged to overlap each other by the optimum amount for minimizing magnetic coupling between the adjacent coil elements, and a mechanism for electrically connecting the respective rf coil units ( connection portion ) is not required. further, the coil elements are folded back such that the physical distance between a subject ( not shown ) on the rf coil unit 300 and each coil element is as close as possible in a portion other than the overlapped portion, thereby a high - sensitivity rf coil is realized. each coil element 301 a to 303 a includes one or more coil elements 300 shown in fig1. in a case where there are a plurality of coil elements 300 in one coil element ( 301 a, for example ), the respective coil elements 300 overlap each other to form the coil element 301 a. a state where the respective coil elements 300 overlap each other is described. the coil elements 300 are arranged to be laid along the inside of the housing of the unit, and one of the coil elements 300 is raised only at an intersection of the coil elements 300. inside the overlapped portion, in a portion other than the intersection of the coils, each coil element 300 is arranged to be laid along the inside of the housing. on the other hand, in a case where portions of the coil elements of different units overlap each other, the coil elements overlap via the housing. therefore, in the portion where the coil elements overlap ( portions 312 and 323 in fig4 ), inside portions where two coils overlap each other, other than the intersection, overlap each other with a width in a vertical direction ( thickness direction ), as shown in fig4. since the coil elements 301 a and 302 a are installed by being laid along the inside of the housings thereof, respectively, two coils are arranged away from each other in the vertical direction by at least two times the thickness of the material ( e. g., plastic ) forming the housing. in a case where the housing is made of plastic material having a width of about 1 cm, the two coils are away from each other by about 2 to 3 cm. in a case where the material is thicker, the two coils may be away from each other by 2 cm or more. next, two embodiments of the present invention are described, using fig5 and 6. in fig5, a plurality of rf coils ( units 302 to 304 ) are provided in addition to a head - portion rf coil ( unit 301 ). in fig6, other than the head - portion rf coil ( unit 301 ), one rf coil ( unit 305 ) is provided. in the embodiment of fig5, the rf coil is divided into at least three units ( four units in fig5 ), the position of the center unit ( 303 in fig5, the center unit is located around the waist of the subject ) is fixed, and the positions of both the adjacent units can be exchanged. in fig6, other than the head - portion unit 301, one unit 305 is provided. the unit 301 can be arranged on both sides of the unit 305 while the unit 305 is fixed. in other words, imaging in head - first mode and imaging in feet - first mode can be easily realized. more specifically, the first rf coil unit 301 and the fifth rf coil unit 305 are installed on the table top 401. the first rf coil unit is an exclusive rf coil generally having the sensitivity range from the head portion to the cervical vertebra of a subject ( not shown ), while the fifth rf coil unit 305 is a general - purpose rf coil having the sensitivity range from under the neck to the toe of the subject ( not shown ). for performing both head - first imaging and feet - first imaging with this configuration, the first rf coil unit 301 is moved to the other side of the fifth rf coil unit 305 on the table top 401. on the other hand, fig5 is a diagram of a plurality of rf coil units into which a permanent rf coil is divided and which can be attached / detached, where the third rf coil unit 303 is arranged around the center portion of the table top 401, the second rf coil unit 302 and the fourth rf coil unit 304 are arranged on both sides of the third rf coil unit 303, and the first rf coil unit 301 is arranged next to the second rf coil unit 302. end portions of the adjacent rf coil units overlap each other so that the end portion of the rf coil unit closer to the center portion of the table top 401 is located on the lower side. as described above, by dividing the rf coil into a number of rf coil units and arranging the rf coil units so that one of them is located at the center of them on the center portion of the table top 401 and the other rf coil units are arranged on the table top in appropriate sizes, the portable table and the rf coil system can be realized which correspond to both head - first imaging and feet - first imaging. as compared with the arrangement of fig6, the arrangement of fig5 can reduce the entire length of the table top 401 while the same sensitivity range is kept, and therefore can reduce the installation space of the device. a second example of the present invention is described below, referring to fig1 and fig7. in this example, an example of division and installation of rf coil units is described which enables the rf coil units to be arranged not only in the longitudinal direction of the table top 401 but also in the lateral direction ( body width direction ). fig7 is a structure diagram showing a third rf coil unit 303, a second rf coil unit 302, and a sixth rf coil unit 309 in the lateral direction ( body width direction ) of a table top 401 of a portable table in an mri device having the portable table 400 which can be attached to and detached from a gantry 100, and shows an exemplary internal structure. in the rf coil unit 300 of the mri device of fig1, fig4 shows an example in which division of the rf coil unit is made in the body axis direction. this example is different from that example in that division is made in the lateral ( body width ) direction of the table top. for portions having the same functions as the structures labeled with the same reference signs in fig1 which have been already described, the description is omitted. moreover, because the second rf coil unit 302 has the same shape as the aforementioned second rf coil unit 302 but is different in the orientation, the same reference numeral is assigned and is additionally assigned. in fig7, an example is shown in which end portions of adjacent rf coil units in the lateral ( body width ) direction of the table top 401 overlap each other as in portions 323 and 392 circled with broken line. the end portion of the third rf coil unit 303 which is closer to the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged on the lower side and the end portion of the second rf coil unit 302 which is farther from the center portion of the table top 401 in the body width direction is arranged on the upper side, so that the overlapped portion 323 is formed. moreover, in a case where the sixth rf coil unit 309 is arranged to be farther away from the center portion of the table top 401 in the body width direction, the overlapped portion 392 is formed in such a manner that the end portion of the second rf coil unit 302 which is closer to the center portion of the table top is arranged on the lower side and the end portion of the sixth rf coil unit 309 is arranged on the upper side. inside the rf coil unit, the third rf coil unit 303, the second rf coil unit 302, and the sixth rf coil unit 309 include the third coil element 303 a, the second coil element 302 a, and the sixth coil element 309 a ; the third feed point 303 b, the second feed point 302 b, and the sixth feed point 309 b ; and the third coil connector 303 c, the second coil connector 302 c, and the sixth coil connector 309 c, respectively, which are connected in a high - frequency manner. the table top 401 includes a fourth table top connector 412 and a fifth table top connector 419, in addition to the aforementioned third table top connector 419. the respective table top connectors are connected to the docking connector 501 via the cable wiring 403. when the respective divided rf coil units are installed on the table top, the third coil connector 303 c is connected to the third table top connector 413, the second coil connector 302 c is connected to the fourth table top connector 412, and the sixth coil connector 309 c is connected to the fifth table top connector 419. similarly to example 1, in a case where the rf coil 300 is a reception coil, the coil elements 303 a, 302 a, and 309 a receive a magnetic resonance signal. the magnetic resonance signal is detected by the feed points 303 b, 302 b, and 309 b. the detected signals are transmitted to the docking connector 501 through the coil connectors 303 c, 302 c, and 309 c and the table top connectors 413, 412, and 419, and further through the cable wiring 403. in fig7, in the overlapped portions 332 and 329, the coil elements 303 a and 302 a spatially overlap each other and the coil elements 302 a and 309 a spatially overlap each other. in this example, the respective rf coil units are designed to overlap each other by the optimum amount for minimizing magnetic coupling between the adjacent coil elements, and a mechanism for electrically connecting the respective rf coil units ( connection portion ) is not required. moreover, the rf coil unit 300 is folded back such that the physical distance between the subject ( not shown ) on the rf coil unit 300 and each coil element is as close as possible in a portion other than the overlapped portion, thereby a highly sensitive rf coil is realized. a third example of the present invention is described below, referring to fig1, 8, 9, and 10. in this example, an example of installation in which the divided rf coil units are arranged in a matrix on the table top 401, an exemplary arrangement of table top connectors provided in the table top 401, and an identification structure for installing the respective coil units at correct installation positions are described. example 1 is characteristic in that the adjacent rf coil units in the body axis direction overlap each other such that the end portion of the rf coil unit closer to the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged on the lower side and the end portion of the rf coil unit farther from the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged on the upper side, and example 2 is characteristic in that the rf coil units adjacent in the body width direction overlap each other in the same manner as that in example 1. this example shown in the upper diagram of fig8 is an example in which the arranging direction of the rf coil units is expanded in both the body axis direction ( 302 - 303 - 302 ) and the body width direction ( 302 - 303 - 302 ), and a diagram is shown in which seventh rf coil units 310 are arranged on the outside of the rf coil units 302 and 302 in the body width direction of the table top. moreover, the lower diagram in fig8 shows an example in which an eighth rf coil unit 311 having a further different shape is arranged on the outside of the rf coil unit 310 in the body width direction. as shown in the lower diagram of fig8, also in the body axis direction, the rf coil unit 301 or 304 can be arranged further outside. fig9 shows the unit shape when the respective rf coil units in the arrangement are divided. in any exemplary arrangement, the rf coil unit 303 which is the closest to the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged at the center, the end portions of the adjacent rf coil units overlap each other, the end portion of the rf coil unit closer to the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged on the lower side, the end portion of the rf coil unit farther from the center portion of the table top 401 is arranged on the upper side, and the rf coil units are arranged in a two - dimensional matrix with no electrical connection therebetween. fig1 shows a cross - section of the table top 401, the rf coil unit 300 arranged thereon, and the divided ( first to third ) rf coil units 301, 302, and 303, when seen from the side. in a case where the rf coil units are arranged two - dimensionally as in this example, it is likely that the table top connectors and the coil connectors are wrongly connected to each other, respectively, if connection relies only on matching of the overlapping shapes of the end portions of the respective rf coil units. therefore, concave / convex portions 362 c, 363 c, 462 c, and 463 c for preventing that are shown. the concave / convex portion 462 c or 463 c is formed in the installation surface of the table top very close to the table top connector, and the convex / concave portion 362 c or 363 c is formed in the installation surface of the bottom surface of each rf coil unit very close to the coil connector. connection of the table top connector and the coil connector to each other can be established only when the concave / convex shapes match each other. in place of the concave / convex portions, marks such as colors, figures, or numerals may be applied on each rf coil unit to be connected and the table top at positions very close to the coil connector and the table top connector, so that correct combination can be determined without electrical connection. the concave / convex portions for preventing wrong connection between the table top connectors and the coil connectors of the respective units or the marks such as colors, figures, or numerals can be applied to the embodiments described in examples 1, 2, and 4. when the portable table is connected to the gantry, an identification command may be issued from the table control portion 200 to data in a coil id memory provided in the coil connector of each rf coil unit to make an access and, if the id is not coincident, a user may be notified that the coil units are wrongly arranged. moreover, when there is a unit which is not connected, that may be recognized and a user may be notified of that. such a user notification of wrong connection or the like can be also applied to the embodiments of examples 1, 2, and 4 in the same manner. as a method for notifying a user of wrong connection or the like, fig1, fig1 or the like may be displayed on the display device 109 so that a wrongly connected portion or a portion not connected is displayed in a different color as warning. also in the embodiments of examples 1, 2, and 4, the wrongly connected unit or the unit not connected is displayed in a different color together with a diagram showing how the coil units are divided as in fig1 or 12. a fourth example of the present invention is described, referring to fig1 and 12. in this example, an example of division and installation of the rf coil units arranged in a matrix on the table top 401 and an example of effectively using the space on the table top 401 are described. in the structure in which the permanent rf coil 300 installed on the table top can be partly attached and detached, in a space for the rf coil unit which has been partly detached, another region exclusive rf coil can be installed instead. for example, fig1 shows an example in which the first rf coil unit 301, the second rf coil unit 302, the seventh rf coil units 310, and the eighth rf coil units 311 have been removed from the state of the lower diagram of fig8 and instead a first region exclusive rf coil unit 321 is installed. for example, when an rf coil exclusive for mammography is used as the rf coil unit 321 as in a case of mammo mri, a higher quality image can be obtained than in a case of using the permanent rf coil installed on the table top. fig1 shows an example in which the fourth rf coil unit 304, the sixth rf coil unit 309, and the eighth rf coil units 311 have been removed from the state of the lower diagram of fig8 and instead a second region exclusive rf coil unit 322 and a third region exclusive rf coil unit 323 are installed. for example, when an rf coil for upper arm imaging is installed as the rf coil unit 322 or an rf coil for knee imaging is installed as the rf coil unit 323, a desired region of interest can be imaged by means of a local rf coil with higher sensitivity. although the above examples describe cases of mammo mri, upper arm imaging, and knee imaging, the present invention is not limited thereto. according to the present invention, a part unit of the permanent rf coil units co - existing can be always arranged closer to the center portion of the table top than the region exclusive rf coil, and, in a case where the end portions of the rf coil units are overlapped to reduce electromagnetic coupling, the permanent rf coil unit can be arranged on the lower side. therefore, it is enough that only the minimum required rf coil unit is removed. furthermore, when electromagnetic coupling is reduced by control of the trap circuit 300 c in the rf coil by the table control portion 200 shown in fig1 in accordance with a pulse sequence, the permanent rf coil which can be partly attached and detached and the region exclusive rf coil can be simultaneously used in combination on a relatively small table top.","a lower cost mri device with a portable table detachable from the gantry is provided along with a lower cost table equipped with an easy - to - use and easy - to - install rf coil system able to perform high - resolution head and neck imaging and high - speed whole body imaging in both head - first and feet - first modes . this magnetic resonance imaging device has a portable table detachable from the gantry , and the portable table has a docking connector that can be connected to the gantry and a ceiling panel on which an rf coil

rf coil units , the ceiling panel has a plurality of ceiling panel connectors enabling each rf coil unit to be connected , and each rf coil unit has a connector . each rf coil unit is arranged in overlapping fashion on the ceiling plate and the ceiling panel connectors and coil connectors are connected without having to establish an electrical connection between rf coil units ."
"fig1 is a plan view of an apparatus according to the invention is shown diagrammatically in which illumination is provided from an emitter 2 which is a laser having output 1. 5 w, a beam width of about 2 mm, at a wavelength of 532 nm ( green ). the beam is fanned, using a cylindrical lens, across a duct 4 from one wall at approximately right angles to the beam wall, 50 % of the cross section of the duct being illuminated. at the opposite wall, a beam dump 6 is provided to absorb illumination received at that point so that essentially no emitted light is reflected back from that wall. sparkles from any particulate in the duct are detected by a 0. 08 lux c / cs mount ccd camera 8 having a 12 mm lens having the centre of its field of view about at an angle of 45 across the duct. the camera is fitted with a zoom lens 10 to focus the field of view, and with a 532 nm filter 12 so as to accept only sparkles caused by light from the emitter, and with a graduated neutral density filter 14 ( c41 - 960 variable density beamsplitter, edmund optics ltd, york england ) to aid normalisation of sparkles occurring close to the camera 8 with those distant from the camera 8. both the emitter 2 and the camera are located outside the wall of the duct 4 so that illumination and sparkle are transmitted through the duct wall through transparent windows ( not shown ). output from the camera 8 is then analysed using a laptop 16 so that required data on levels of particulate, e. g. identification and quantification of sparkles along the observed length, and any increase in levels with time can be calculated and monitored and any action re the particulate abatement system taken if required. fig2 is a 3 - dimensional diagram of a illumination beam from the laser described in example 1 in which the beam has been fanned using an optical lens across substantially the whole cross section of a duct ; the emitter was positioned at a corner of the duct. in a further embodiment of this apparatus, the beam from the laser is mechanically scanned using a stepper motor across substantially the whole cross section of the duct. fig3 and 4 show diagrammatically an apparatus according to the invention in which back scatter is detected using illumination from a laser emitter having 3 mw output at wavelength 680 nm. the apparatus is mounted at right angles to the direction of gas flow. the illumination from the laser emitter is fanned using an optical line generator which spreads ( i. e. fans ) the beam in one plane through 80 so that 60 % of the cross sectional area of the duct is illuminated. back scatter is detected using four phototransistors 18 arranged as a square around the emitter 2. the output from the phototransistors is then amplified using high gain ac - coupled amplifiers 20 and summing amp 22 so that any effects of ambient light ( including varying changing ambient light ) are minimised, and so that only transient sparkles from passing particulate are captured. in this embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, the pc stores information received from the amplifiers, and then calculates the root mean square ( rms ) of the amplitudes of that information to produce a figure for of particulate concentration across the illuminated area. results of a number of rms calculations are compared in table 1 with alpha ( trade mark, unidata europe limited, sheffield, england ) readings ( a well established system which comprises a single path optical particulate beam monitor which records point to point measurements of particulate and then assumes that level uniformly over the whole area ). the results show that the apparatus is sensitive to passing particulate in the detectable range of the laser head. a large rms reading shows a good correspondence to the large alpha reading ( test 6 ) ; in respect of the low alpha readings, electrical and optical noise tended to distort the rms reading, but more sophisticated electronics would remedy same. however the apparatus of preferred embodiments of the present invention advantageously detects and monitors particulate over a substantial portion of the duct. fig5 shows diagrammatically a scanning arrangement for use in the apparatus of the invention. in this arrangement, an illumination beam from the laser 2 is directed to a mirror 24 located on a shaft of a gearbox 26 from a stepper motor 28. the illumination from the mirror 24 may then be detected using detectors arranged as required. a home detector 25 may be used as a positional reference and for assisting in calculating any backlash in the gearbox 26. a suitable stepper motor 28 has a step angle of 1. 8 ( half step mode 0. 9 ), step angle accuracy 5 %, voltage 5v ; rated current 0. 5 a / phase. a suitable gearbox 26 scans essentially the entire cross section of a duct ; it is also has a ratio of 100 : 1 ( step angle 0. 0180 / 0. 0090 ). such a scanning arrangement is robust, vibration proof and capable being used over a wide temperature range, has low scan speed, repeatable positional information, and is easy to maintain. in this example, a series of experiments was carried out in one gantry of a filter house of a gas turbine electricity generating station, in which the apparatus of the invention was located in a duct upstream of the turbine in the gas inlet to the turbine. the gantry was about 15 m long and about 1 m wide. the apparatus was set up adjacent an array of filters in the gantry. an apparatus similar to that in fig3 and example 3 except that the laser emitter had power between 200 mw and 1. 6 w at a wavelength of 532 nm. the variable power allowed for rapid evaluation of the performance of the system over a wide range of optical power levels. the detector was a photodiode provided with a 35 mm - 70 mm zoom lens, an optical band pass filter tuned to 532 nm, signal conditioners and amplifiers so that the signal could be fed to a digital oscilloscope and pc for storage of data. the detector system used is shown diagrammatically in fig4. tests were carried out at various laser power outputs. background signals were taken ( i. e. with only ambient particulate present ) and after introduction of particulate by sprinkling particulate into the monitored portion of the laser emitter beam. fig6 a and 6 b are oscilloscope traces at a laser power of 1. 6 w, bias 5 a, gain 23 from with background particulate ( 0. 22 mg / m 3 ) and after introduction of particulate into the duct ( 9. 74 mg / m 3 ) respectively. fig7 a and 7 b are oscilloscope traces at a laser power of 500 mw, bias 5 a, gain 48 from with background particulate ( 0. 22 mg / m 3 ) and after introduction of particulate ( 11. 2 mg / m 3 ) respectively. from fig6 b and fig7 b it can be seen that the presence of particulate is readily detected.","an apparatus and method are provided for detecting presence in gas of transient particulate above its normal zero or acceptable level within a duct , said apparatus comprising at least one emitter of illumination selected from infra - red , ultraviolet and visible radiation capable of being projected over essentially the entire cross section of the duct and at least one detector for detecting any sparkle of the illumination from the particulate . the apparatus and method are in particular useful for detecting monitoring particulate in areas where build up or presence of particulate can be disadvantageous , for example hospitals and electricity generating stations ."
"fig3 illustrates a method of creating a tile - switch mapping architecture according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. referring to fig3, a core communication graph ( ccg ) 310 representing the connection of cores is created. the connection of cores is determined at the request of an soc designer. a case where a first core s is connected to a second core d will be explained as an example. a network - on - chip architecture ( noc ) 320 including a plurality of switches, a plurality of tiles and a plurality of links connecting the switches is created. for the convenience of explanation assume that the noc 320 is a two - dimensional mesh. however, the noc 320 is not limited to a two - dimensional mesh. when the ccg 310 and the noc 320 are created, a core - tile mapping architecture 340 is created, in which cores and tiles are mapped by a conventional core - tile mapping method ( ctm ) 330. for the convenience of explanation assume that the first core s is mapped to a first tile k, and the second core d is mapped to a second tile l. when the core - tile mapping architecture 340 is created, the cores are mapped to switches using a predetermined optimized mapping method 350, to create an optimized tile - switch mapping architecture 360. in the tile - switch mapping architecture 360 created by the optimized mapping method 350, the hop distance between the first core s and the second core d is minimized, and the energy and the communication delay time required when data is transmitted and received are minimized. the optimized mapping method 350 will now be explained in more detail with reference to fig4, which is a flow chart of the method of creating a tile - switch mapping architecture of fig3. referring to fig4, the optimized mapping method 350 includes first, second and third calculation steps. for the convenience of explanation assume that the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture is obtained when the first core s is mapped to the first tile k, the second core d is mapped to the second tile l, a first switch i, one of the switches abutting the first tile k, is connected to the first tile k, and a second switch j, one of the switches abutting the second tile l, is connected to the second tile l. it is assumed that the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture is obtained when the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped is connected to the first switch i and the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped is connected to the second switch j. a proximity index value is used to indicate the proximity of a switch to a tile or a core to a tile. the proximity index values will indicate whether or not a particular switch abuts a particular tile or if a particular core is mapped to a particular tile. the optimized mapping method 350 can be represented by expression 1, 1 s, d sd s, d k, l sd kl i s k, j s i h ij f kl ij. a plurality of result values are obtained when the calculation according to expression 1 is carried out while varying proximity index values of the first and second cores s and d, and the first and second tiles k and l, and the hop distance value between the first and second switches i and j. these result values correspond to hop distances between the first and second cores s and d. accordingly, the proximity index values of the first and second cores s and d, and of the first and second tiles k and l, and the hop distance values of the first and second switches i and j, which can obtain the minimum value of the result values, form the optimized mapping architecture. the first step 410 of creating the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture using the optimized mapping method 350 will now be explained. the first step 410 multiplies the data communication flow from the first tile k to the second tile l by the hop distance value between the first and second switches i and j. specifically, the first step 410 changes the hop distance value of the first and second switches i and j to the hop distance values of switches abutting the first tile k and the hop distance values of switches abutting the second tile l, carries out the multiplication for the changed hop distance values, and then sums the multiplication result values. the first step performs the rightmost summing operation ( sigma operation ) of expression 1. in expression 1, f kl ij represents the data communication flow and h ij denotes the hop distance value between the first and second switches i and j. in addition, s k and s l respectively represent the switches abutting the first tile k and the switches abutting the second tile l. there may be a plurality of switches that abut the first and second tiles k and l. the first and second switches i and j are selected from the switches abutting the first and second tiles k and l to calculate the data communication flow and the hop distance value, and the two terms are multiplied together. then, the hop distance value of the first and second switches i and j is changed to the hop distance values of the switches abutting the first and second tiles k and l, the data communication flow and the hop distance value for the changed hop distance values are calculated, and the data communication flow is multiplied by the hop distance value. when the noc architecture is a two - dimensional mesh as in the embodiment of the present invention, there are four switches abutting each of the first and second tiles k and l. thus, four result values are obtained when the calculation of the first step is carried out for the first and second switches i and j, and the four result values are summed according to the summing operation ( sigma operation ). the data communication flow has the value 1 if the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped is connected to the first switch i and the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped is connected to the second switch j, but has the value 0 otherwise. the case where the first switch i is mapped to the first tile k to which the first core s is connected and the second switch j is mapped to the second tile l to which the second core d is connected has been assumed to be the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture. accordingly, the data communication flow has the value 1 only in the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture but has the value 0 in other architectures. i s k, j s i f kl ij = 1, where f kl ij denotes the data communication flow, m ki represents the case where the first switch i is connected to the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped, and m ij represents the case where the second switch j is connected to the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped. here, m ki and m lj have the value 1 if the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped is connected to the first switch i and the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped is connected to the second switch j, but have the value 0 otherwise. accordingly, the data communication flow becomes 1 in the optimized architecture in which the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped is connected to the first switch i and the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped is connected to the second switch j. the second step 420 multiplies the communication volume between the first core s and the second core d by the result value of the first step, when the first core s is mapped to the first tile k and the second core d is mapped to the second tile l. specifically, the second step changes proximity index values of the first and second tiles k and l to the proximity index values of all tiles, carries out the multiplication for the changed tile proximity index values, and sums the multiplication result values. the second step 420 performs the second summing operation ( sigma operation ) of expression 1 including the calculation of the first step. in expression 1, the communication volume between the first and second cores s and d is represented by sd kl when the first core s is mapped to the first tile k and the second core d is mapped to the second tile l. the calculation of the first step is carried out while changing proximity index values of the first and second tiles k and l to the proximity index values of all tiles. then, the hop distance value and communication data flow are calculated for all tiles and all switches abutting the tiles, and the two terms are multiplied together. each of the multiplication result values is multiplied by the communication volume sd kl that is obtained while changing the proximity index values of the first and second tiles k and l to the proximity index values of all tiles. the communication volume relates to the quantity of data communication between the first core s and the second core d, and functions as a weight value. the third step 430 carries out the calculation of the second step for all cores, and then sums the calculation result values. the third step 430 performs the third summing operation ( sigma operation ) of expression 1, including the operation of the second step 420. specifically, the calculations of the first and second steps are carried out while changing the proximity index values of the first and second cores s and d to the proximity index values of all cores. then, the hop distance, data communication flow and communication volume are calculated for all cores, all tiles and all switches abutting the tiles. the result values obtained through these calculations are summed to acquire the minimum hop distance between the first switch i and the second switch j. here, the first switch i is connected to the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped, and the second switch j is connected to the second tile l to which the second core d is mapped. the architecture of mapping the cores, tiles and switches which corresponds to the minimum hop distance forms the optimized tile - switch mapping architecture capable of minimizing energy consumption and communication delay time. the optimized mapping method 350 can further include a fourth step that divides the result of the third step by the communication volume between the first and second cores s and d, which has been carried out for all cores, to determine the first and second tiles k and l for which the average hop distance between the first and second switches i and j is minimum. the first through fourth steps are executed under the following conditions. restrictions on the mapping of cores and tiles are described. the number of cores is equal to or less than the number of tiles, and no more than one core is mapped to a single tile. that is, one core is mapped to one tile. on the other hand, one tile can be mapped to one core or not mapped to any core. the number of switches connected to a single core is greater than 1 and less than 4. this means that the number of switches connected to a single tile is also greater than 1 and less than 4. the relationship between tiles and switches is represented by expression 3, 1 i s k m ki d c, where d c denotes the maximum number of switches connected to a single core, and 1 d c 4 when the noc has a two - dimensional mesh architecture. in addition, m ki is 1 if the first switch i is connected to the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped, and m ki is 0 otherwise, and s k represents the switches abutting the first tile k. the term of expression 3 becomes one value between 1 and 4 when the first core s is mapped to the first tile k. thus, the number of switches connected to a single tile is larger than 1 and smaller than 4. in addition, the number of cores connected to a single switch is larger than 1 and smaller than 4. this means that the number of tiles connected to a single switch is greater than 1 and less than 4. the relationship between cores and switches is represented by expression 4, 0 k t i m ki d s, where d s denotes the maximum number of cores connected to a single switch, and 1 d s 4 when the noc has a two - dimensional mesh architecture. in addition, m ki is 1 if the switch i is connected to the first tile k to which the first core s is mapped, and m ki is 0 otherwise, and t i represents the tiles abutting the first switch i. of expression 4 becomes one value between 0 to 4. accordingly, the number of cores connected to a single switch is greater than 0 and less than 4. the bandwidth of an arbitrary link should be less than or equal to the maximum bandwidth that can be simultaneously maintained in the link. furthermore, the maximum bandwidth of the arbitrary link must not exceed the link capacity. the bandwidth of the link is represented by expression 5, k, l i s k, j s l b sd r xy ij f kl ij = b xy, where b xy means the bandwidth of the link between arbitrary first and second routes x and y between the first and second switches i and j, and b sd denotes the bandwidth required for the data communication flow from the first core s to the second core d. in addition, b max represents the maximum bandwidth simultaneously maintained in the arbitrary link, and c denotes the link capacity that is the maximum data capacity that the arbitrary link can transfer. the link between the first and second switches i and j connecting the first and second cores s and d must have a sufficient bandwidth for transmitting and receiving data. the bandwidth b xy of the link between the first and second routes x and y must be smaller than the maximum bandwidth b max. furthermore, the maximum bandwidth b max must be smaller than the maximum data capacity c the link can transfer. in expression 5, r xy ij is 1 if the first and second routes x and y exist between the first and second switches i and j, and 0 otherwise. based on the aforementioned conditions and the first through fourth steps, the optimized tile -

"in the following, the embodiments of the present invention are described in detail in reference to the drawings. here, the same symbols are attached to parts having the same functions throughout all the drawings illustrating the embodiments, and repeated descriptions are omitted. fig1 is a cross sectional diagram schematically showing a main portion of the cross sectional structure of one subpixel of the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. fig2 is a plan diagram showing the electrode structure of the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. here, fig1 is a cross sectional diagram showing the cross sectional structure along line a - a of fig2. in the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, a first substrate ( sub 1 ) and a second substrate ( sub 2 ) are provided so as to sandwich a liquid crystal layer ( lc ). in the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, the main surface side of the second substrate ( sub 2 ) is a viewed side. as shown in fig1, a scanning line ( which is also referred to as gate line ) ( gl ) or a reflection layer ( ral ), an interlayer insulating film ( pas 3 ), a video line ( which is also referred to as source line or drain line, not shown ) ( dl ) or a thin film transistor ( tft ), an interlayer insulating film ( pas 2 ), a facing electrode ( which is also referred to as common electrode ) ( ct ), an interlayer insulating film ( pas 1 ), a pixel electrode ( px ) and an orientation film ( al 1 ) are formed on the liquid crystal layer side of the first substrate ( which is also referred to as tft substrate ) ( sub 1 ) sequentially from the first substrate ( sub 1 ) to the liquid crystal layer ( lc ). here, a polarization plate ( pol 1 ) is formed on the outside of the first substrate ( sub 1 ). in addition, the reflection layer ( ral ) is connected to the facing electrode ( ct ), and the same drive voltage as that for the facing electrode ( ct ) is supplied to the reflection layer ( ral ). here, the reflection layer ( ral ) may be a diffuse reflection layer where unevenness is created on the surface. a light shielding film ( bm ), an orientation film ( al ) for orienting an incorporated phase difference film, the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ), a color filter for red, green and blue ( cf ), a flattened film ( oc ), a step forming layer ( mr ) and an orientation film ( al 2 ) are formed on the liquid crystal layer side of a second substrate ( which is also referred to as color filter substrate ) ( sub 2 ) sequentially from the second substrate ( sub 2 ) to the liquid crystal layer ( lc ). here, a polarization plate ( pol 2 ) is formed on the outside of the second substrate ( sub 2 ). in addition, as shown in fig2, the facing electrode ( ct ) is formed in plane form, and the pixel electrode ( px ) is a comb shaped electrode having a number of linear electrodes. in general, the pixel electrode ( px ) and the facing electrode ( ct ) are formed of a transparent conductive film, such as of ito ( indium tin oxide ), or the like. furthermore, the pixel electrode ( px ) and the facing electrode ( ct ) overlap via the interlayer insulating film ( pas 1 ), and as a result, a capacitor is formed. here, the interlayer insulating film ( pas 1 ) is not limited to being one layer, but may be of two or more layers. here, as shown in fig2, one subpixel is formed within a rectangular region surrounded scanning lines ( gl ) and video lines ( dl ). light is shielded by the light shielding film ( bm ) formed on the second substrate ( sub 2 ) side in the region where this one subpixel is formed, and therefore, the region ( pt ) which functions as the region where one subpixel is substantially formed is the opening of the light shielding film ( bm ). in addition, fig2 shows the reflection layer ( ral ) with broken lines. in the present embodiment, the reflection layer ( ral ) is formed on the first substrate ( sub 1 ) side. the region where this reflection layer ( ral ) is formed is a reflection portion 31, and light entering through the second substrate ( sub 2 ) side is reflected from the reflection layer ( ral ) in the reflection portion 31. in addition, the region where the reflection layer ( ral ) is not formed is a transmission portion 30, and illumination light from a backlight arranged on the rear side of the first substrate ( sub 1 ) passes through the transmission portion 30 and is emitted through the main surface side of the second substrate ( sub 2 ). the reflection layer ( ral ) may be a metal film, such as of aluminum ( al ), or may have a two - layer structure of molybdenum ( mo ) in the lower layer and aluminum ( al ) in the upper layer. in the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, the linear pixel electrode ( px ) and the facing electrode in plane form ( ct ) are layered on top of each other via the interlayer insulating film ( pas 1 ) so that lines of electric force in arch form formed between the pixel electrode ( px ) and the facing electrode ( ct ) are distributed so as to penetrate through the liquid crystal layer ( lc ), and thus, the orientation of the liquid crystal layer ( lc ) is changed. in the present embodiment, the gap between the first substrate ( sub 1 ) and the second substrate ( sub 2 ) is set to a predetermined length by the spacer in columnar form ( spa ), and the length of the gap between cells in the reflection portion 31 is set at approximately half of the length of the gap between cells in the transmission portion 30 due to the step forming layer ( mr ). this is because light passes through the reflection portion 31 twice, traveling forward and then backwards, and the light path length should be the same in the transmission portion 30 and the reflection portion 31. the brightness and darkness of light are displayed using the birefringence of the liquid crystal layer ( lc ) in the transmission portion 30, while the brightness and darkness of light are displayed using the birefringence of the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) and the liquid crystal layer ( lc ) arranged inside the liquid crystal display panel in the reflection portion. fig3 is a diagram illustrating a manufacturing method for the second substrate ( sub 2 ) shown in fig1. in the present embodiment, the second substrate ( sub 2 ) shown in fig1 is formed in accordance with the following method, for example. as shown in fig3 ( a ), a light shielding film ( bm ) is formed on the second substrate ( sub 2 ). this light shielding film ( bm ) is formed using a publicly known photoetching technique, for example. next, an orientation film ( al ) for an incorporated phase difference film is formed on this light shielding film ( bm ), and an orientation process is carried out on this orientation film ( al ) in accordance with a rubbing method. here, the orientation film ( al ) has a function of determining the direction of the late phase axis of the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ). next, a phase difference resist ( for example, an organic solvent including a liquid crystal having a photoreactive acryl group at a terminal of the molecule and a reaction initiator ) is applied onto the orientation film ( al ), and the organic solvent is removed through heating. at this point in time, the photoreactive liquid crystal is oriented in the direction of the orientation process for the orientation film ( al ). next, the acryl group is photopolymerized through irradiation with ultraviolet rays 10 via the photomask 11 so that the portion irradiated with ultraviolet rays 10 is cured. next, the unexposed portion which is not irradiated with ultraviolet rays 10 is eluded in an organic solvent for development, and thus, as shown in fig3 ( b ), an incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) patterned in the same manner as the reflection portion 31 is formed. subsequently, a color filter ( cf ), a flattened film ( oc ), a step forming layer ( mr ), a spacer in columnar form ( spa ) and an orientation film ( al 2 ) are formed. here, the flattened film ( oc ), the step forming layer ( mr ) and the spacer in columnar form ( spa ) may not be formed if unnecessary. fig4 is a diagram showing the light shielding film ( bm ) of the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, and fig5 is a diagram showing the light shielding film ( bm ) of the conventional semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device described in the above patent document 1. here, in fig4 and 5 as well as the below described fig6, the regions ( pt ) which function as the region where one subpixel is substantially formed are shown with thick lines, and furthermore, the incorporated phase difference films ( ret ) are shown with broken lines. as shown in fig5, in the conventional semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device, the light shielding film ( bm ) is formed so as to surround one subpixel, but no light shielding film ( bm ) is formed in the border portion between the transmission portion 30 and the reflection portion 31. in contrast, in the semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, the light shielding film ( bm ) is formed so as to surround one subpixel, and at the same time, the light shielding film ( bm ) is formed in the border portion between the transmission portion 30 and the reflection portion 31. that is to say, according to the present embodiment, the light shielding film ( bm ) is in a pattern having a portion which only surrounds the reflection portion 31, and thus, a resist film for an incorporated phase difference film having no gap can be formed, and therefore, the effects of repelling of the film can be reduced while the film is surrounded by the light shielding film ( bm ) even when repelling of the film occurs so that the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) does not flow out into the transmission portion 30, and the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) can be formed inside the reflection portion 31 without fail. here, as shown in fig4 ( b ), it is not necessary to form a light shielding film ( bm ) in the border between the reflection portion 31 and the reflection portion 31 between two subpixels adjacent to each other. here, as shown in fig4 ( b ), it is necessary to surround the reflection portion 31 in the outermost portion. here, as shown in fig6, the light shielding film ( bm ) may be formed only around the reflection portion 31. in this case, the amount of transmitted light from the backlight, which is shielded by the light shielding film ( bm ), can be increased, and therefore, it becomes possible to increase the brightness of the liquid crystal display panel. in addition, in the same manner as in fig4 ( b ), it is not necessary to form the light shielding film ( bm ) in the border between the reflection portion 31 and the reflection portion 31 between two subpixels adjacent to each other, as shown in fig6 ( b ). here, as shown in fig6 ( b ), it is necessary to surround the reflection portion 31 in the outermost portion. in addition, the orientation film ( al ) for an incorporated phase difference film may be formed only in the region where the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) is formed. in addition to the above described effects, it is possible to gain resistance to corrosion of the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) as well as coloring and decomposing prevention effects of the orientation film through irradiation with uv or duv during the process for exposure to uv or duv when the spacer in columnar form ( spa ) is formed, for example, by using an already existing film, since in the present embodiment, the orientation film ( al ) for orienting an incorporated phase difference film and the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) are formed after the formation of the light shielding film ( bm ) on the second substrate ( sub 2 ), and top of this, the color filter ( cf ) and the flattened film ( oc ) are formed. as described above, in the present embodiment, the color filter ( cf ) and the flattened film ( oc ) can also be used as a protective transparent resin film for protecting the incorporated phase difference film, and therefore, the protective transparent resin film becomes unnecessary, and furthermore, it is possible to form the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) without changing the conventional process for patterning through development. in addition, the color filter ( cf ) and the flattened film ( oc ) are formed on top of the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ), and therefore, the flatness of the base on which the step forming layer ( mr ) is formed can be increased, and the control of the film thickness of the step forming layer ( mr ) becomes easy, and thus, it becomes easy to adjust the length of the gap between the transmission portion 30 and the reflection portion 31. furthermore, a sequence of processes for forming the incorporated phase difference film ( ret ) is arranged after the process for forming the light shielding film ( bm ), and thus, it becomes possible to prevent the yield from lowering due to factors caused in the process, such as the flatness of the base on which the step forming layer ( mr ) is formed and a foreign substance. moreover, the light shielding film ( bm ) is patterned so as to have a portion which surrounds only the reflection portion 31, and thus, a resist film for an incorporated phase difference film without a gap can be formed so that it becomes possible to reduce the effects of repelling of the film. here, though an embodiment where the present invention is applied to a semi - transmission type liquid crystal display having an ips system is described in the above, the present invention is not limited to this and can be applied to a semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device having an ecb system and a semi - transmission type liquid crystal display device having a va system, for example. in these cases, the facing electrode ( ct ) is formed on the second substrate ( sub 2 ) side instead of on the first substrate ( sub 1 ) side. though the invention made by the present inventor is described concretely on the basis of the above described embodiments, the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments and can, of course, be modified variously within the scope of not deviating from the gist of the invention.","in a liquid crystal display device into which a phase difference film is incorporated on the color filter substrate side , the phase difference film can be formed more easily than the prior art . a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal display panel having a liquid crystal sandwiched between the above described pair of substrates are provided in such a manner that the above described liquid crystal display panel has a number of subpixels , each subpixel in the above described number of subpixels has a transmission portion and a reflection portion , and a first substrate from among the above described pair of substrates has : a light blocking film which is formed at least in a border between the above described transmission portion and the above described reflection portion and at least has a portion which surrounds only the above described reflection portion ; an orientation film for orienting the phase difference film formed on the above described light blocking film ; a phase difference film formed inside the portion surrounded by the above described light blocking film on the above described orientation film ; a color filter formed on the above described phase difference film ; and a flattened film formed on the above described color filter ."
"several welding processes which have proven satisfactory in laboratory testing are unable to perform adequate welds in the field, as those taught in u. s. pat. nos. 5, 773, 779 and 5, 877, 468 which are incorporated by reference, because of a lack of adjustment and adaptability as provided by this gap welding process. it should also be understood that the invention here is applicable to robotic welding of any workpiece which is substantially immovable, however the principles are described with particular reference to rail welding. the prior art robotic calibration problem is a result of applying the typical method of robotic control such as one used in a manufacturing assembly line where work pieces are brought to a fixed welder. when the typical method of robotic control is used, which is one where the robotic welder is in a fixed location, the operator manually positions the robotic welder and pieces to be welded so the proper gap size is created. once the pieces are properly positioned, fixed stops are used so subsequent pieces to be welded can be positioned in the exact location as the original. when using a fixed robotic welder, pieces to be welded have identical weld face orientation which is accomplished by the use of precise cutting methods and the ability of the operator to manually position the pieces so that the faces to be welded are parallel to each other. when the robotic welder 30 is brought out into the field, each weld gap 32 encountered is unique from the next. to perform a weld, the robotic welder 30 needs to be moved to the next gap location and realigned. due to the immovable nature of the weld pieces, the gap welding process 10 must sense the location, orientation and origin position of the faces of the pieces that define the gap and make adjustments to weld coordinate data so it can accurately and completely fill in the weld gap 32. a preferred embodiment of the gap welding process 10 of the present invention is shown in the flow diagram of fig1. the gap welding process 10 includes three processes that are needed to accurately and completely fill the weld gap 32 between two pieces 51 to be welded. the three processes include the data transfer process 12, the gap sensing process 14, and the robotic welding process 16. it will be understood that the problems are not necessarily unique to rail welding, as other on site welds, such as in architectural construction, or ship - building, to name some examples, could also benefit from the teachings herein. the gap welding process 10, which is made up of these several robotic control and sensing processes, is capable of welding a gap between two pieces of metal with variations in gap location, orientation and position. the advantages of the gap welding process 10 is the ability to locate the boundaries of the weld gap so the robotic control program 24 can continuously move the gas arc welding torch through the gap between the two pieces to be welded to properly produce a sound and accurate weld. the gap welding process 10 is initiated with the transfer of weld data, which is performed by the data transfer process 12. the data transfer process 12, best shown in the flow diagram of fig2, allows predetermined welding position data which is stored as spreadsheet data 18 to be converted into weld program data 22 by the data conversion program 20. the spreadsheet data 18 are stored information needed to instruct the robotic welder 30. the operator has the option of choosing a preselected group of spreadsheets or can create a customized group by selecting individual spreadsheet data 18. other spreadsheet data can be substituted depending on the dimensions of the pieces to be welded. once selected, the spreadsheet data 18 is converted by the data conversion program 20 to the weld program data 22 that can be used to position the robotic welder 30. the weld program data 22 contains variables in the x - y - z - w - p - r coordinate system that allows for three dimensional positioning and rotation of the robotic welder 30. the stored weld program data 22 also includes, but is not limited to, point position, user frame to be used, weld schedule, seam tracking schedule, weave schedule, azimuth orientation, travel speed, weave time and digital output control data. the data transfer process 12 allows for instantaneous transfer of weld program data 22 needed by the robotic control program 24 to perform a complete weld. the robotic control program can easily and automatically manipulate information stored in the weld program data. the data conversion program 20 is a higher level programming language program, which transfers the weld program data 22 into a program data memory location within a robotic control program 24. the weld program data 22 provides detailed information so the robotic control program 24 can accurately maneuver the robotic welder 30 in the weld gap 32 relative to the user frames that will be defined in the gap sensing process. the spreadsheet data 18 can be created or altered depending upon the object to be welded. spreadsheets can be selected by the operator, as needed depending on the complexity or simplicity of the weld subject matter. the data transfer process 12 does not provides enough information for the robotic control program 24 to manipulate within a gap, additional physical data is required so the robotic control program 24 can conform to a specific weld gap 32. the process that provides the physical data is the gap sensing process 14. the gap sensing process 14, best shown in the flow diagram of fig3, is designed to accurately measure the location, orientation and position of the gap 32 to be welded and store the acquired information as weld variance data 26 to be used by the robotic control program 24. weld variance data 26 is made up of user frames 34 and offsets 36. user frames 36 are stored weld gap 32 data for the different weld face configurations. one geometrical plane of the user frames 36, determined by gap sensing, is formed by the face of the piece to be welded in relation to the coordinate position of the robotic welder 30. offsets 36 are the measurements of the differences in actual dimension from the nominal dimension caused by manufacturing wear or handling, determined by the gap - sensing program 28 and used to make adjustments to weld program data. the gap sensing process 14 utilizes a gap sensing program 28 which is a high level programming language program to maneuver the robotic welder 30 to touch the pieces to be welded which form the weld gap 32, to determine user frames 3 and 4 and offsets 36. the gap - sensing program 28 determines user frames to define the boundaries of the gap 32 to be welded. the gap sensing process 14, as shown in fig4, is initiated by placing the robotic welder 38 to within inch spherical proximity of a location 50 that has a relationship to the gap 32 formed by the pieces to be welded. it will be readily observed that fig5, 6 and 7 do not show this gap 32 to scale, being exaggerated for clarity. this orientation and location of the robot with respect to the gap 32 formed by the pieces to be welded is arbitrarily designated as user frame 1. user frame 1 is a relatively gross orientation and location between the robot and the gap to be welded and is used as the coordinate system for the start of the gap sensing process. the arbitrary first user frame to be determined by the gap sensing program 28 is the geometrical face 52 of the piece to be welded, best shown in fig7, which is closest to the robotic welder 30 and is arbitrarily designated as user frame 4. to determine the geometrical plane of user frame 4, and to determine orientation of the gap face within the plane, the gap sensing program 28 maneuvers the robotic welder 30 so the torch tip and / or weld wire 38 contacts the face 52 of the piece to be welded or the fixturing at several locations. the points of contact typically include the two bottom corner points 54 and 56 of the face, the top center point 58 along with other points, but many point combinations may be incorporated. the torch tip and / or weld wire 38 is electrically charged so when it comes into contact with the piece to be welded or fixturing, which is grounded, a circuit is completed. the gap - sensing program 28 senses the presence of a completed circuit and stops the robotic welder 30 and records its position in the x - y - z coordinate system. once contact takes place, the robotic weld & # 39 ; s 30 position is recorded and moved to the next location on the face until all needed points are gathered to determine user frame 4. after collecting the points that make up user frame 4, the robotic welder 30 is instructed by the gap sensing program 28 to determine the next user frame. this is the face that opposes user frame 4 and is arbitrarily designated as user frame 3. to determine the geometrical plane of user frame 3, and to determine orientation of the gap face within that plane, the gap sensing program 28 maneuvers the robotic welder 30 so the torch tip and / or welding wire 38 contacts the face 52 of the piece to be welded or fixturing at several locations. the points of contact typically include the two bottom corner points 65 and 66 of the face, the top center point 67 along with other points, but many point combinations may be incorporated. the operation of using the gap sensing program 28 to determine the geometrical plane of a user frame and orientation of the face of the piece to be welded within that plane is repeated until all necessary user frames have been defined and oriented. once the data points are gathered for all user frames, the robotic control program 24 calculates an arbitrarily chosen user frame 2, which is an imaginary geometrical plane which has a certain orientation to previously determined user frames. user frame 2 gives the robotic control program 24 a plane of reference when performing welding functions that are not oriented to a gap face. after gathering the necessary user frame data, the robotic control program 24 determines the gap offsets 36 of the pieces to be welded by positioning the torch tip and / or welding wire 38 to touch the outside 60, inside 62 and top 64 of the pieces to be welded to determine if any parts of the piece are offset in the x - y - z direction from the expected coordinates as represented in the weld program data 22. offset determination is a crucial step in the gap welding process 10 because the weld program data 22 only provides the robotic control program 24 with the welding data for ideal weld gap conditions and does not compensate for dimensional variations in the pieces to be welded. when on - site welding, it is not uncommon to encounter material to be welded that has been deformed due to wear or other elemental factors such as manufacturing defects or damage due to improper handling. offsets 36 as well as user frames are needed so the robotic control program 24 can vary the weld program data 22 to accurately conform to the weld gap 32. weld variance data 26, which encompasses the user frames and offsets is used by the robotic control program 24 to determine whether the weld gap is within the allowable welding tolerance. if the weld gap 32 is larger or smaller than the acceptable tolerance limits, the robotic control program 24 will abort and no weld will be made. the variance data allows the gap welding process 10 to be adapted to each individual weld gap 32. the gap sensing program 28, which uses a higher level programming language, uses the data received by physically touching the pieces to be welded to initialize the weld variance data 26. the initializing of the weld variance data 26 is when the gap sensing program 28 initializes the user frames to best fit the orientation of the weld gap 32, faces 52 and edges 53 and sets the offsets 36 to be used in the robotic welding process 10. the robotic welding process 16, as shown in the flow diagram in fig4, features the robotic control program 24 which receives input data in the form of weld variance data 26, weld program data 22 and feedback data 44. the robotic control program 24 uses the input data to determine where to position the robotic welder 30. the robotic control program 24 can manipulate the weld variance data 26 and the weld program data 22 based on information received from the real time feedback data 44 such as position and amperage. the manipulated data may be used by the robotic control program 24 to transmit computer instructions directly to the robotic welding control software 46 or due to differences in programming language, an instruction translation may be required. if a computer instruction translation is required to transform the high level programming language instructions to low level programming language instruction, the robotic control program 24 can transmit the instructions to the lower level welding program 48 where the higher level welding program language instructions are converted into a format that can be understood by the robotic welding control software 46. it has been determined that the programming language known as karel is a suitable programming language for the invention described herein. the lower level welding program 48 first receives instructions from the robot control program 24 and then the lower level welding program 48 written in a low level programming language is used as an instruction translating program. the converted instructions are then transmitted from the lower level welding program 48 to the robotic welding control software that instructs the robotic welder 30 to properly position the welding torch and perform the appropriate operations, which produce a sound and accurate weld in the weld gap 32. various features of the invention have been particularly shown and described in connection with the illustrated embodiment of the invention, however, it must be understood that these particular arrangements merely illustrate, and that the invention is to be given its fullest interpretation.","a gap welding process for manipulating a movable robotic welder for making a weld between two or more substantially immovable work pieces using a higher level programming language . the gap welding process performs a data transfer routine which takes spreadsheet data representing expected variables , runs a data conversion program that creates weld program data including point position , user frames , weld schedule , seam tracking schedule , weave schedule , azimuth orientation , travel speed , wait time , weave type and number of digital output control data . the gap welding process also performs a gap -

"the architecture of the disclosed art is based on the client - driven intelligent content delivery platform. the preferred embodiment of the present invention is described as a client - server solution for enhancing security of web transactions. the preferred embodiment has three functional modules located at three different locations referred herein as nodes. the three nodes are a ) the client terminal 10, b ) the authentication server 12, and c ) the network servers 14. the practical implementation of the preferred embodiment begins with the user inserting the rock od card 18 in the odd 20 of the client machine ( node 1 client terminal 10 ). the rock system uses the following program algorithm modules on the card device and their corresponding remote components on the client and the server. 1. odd controller 22 gains control of the cd rom / dvd functions during the online transaction, by controlling the cd rom / dvd device drivers. sets compulsory auto run. inactivates all user functions such as cd data access, viewing, copying etc. enables compulsory auto eject after transaction completion and on any illegal command. 2. os controller 24 cordons off the rock application by closing all programs, applications and hidden processes, to prevent data hijack by spy programs. it also prevents the launch of any concurrent program during the running of rock transaction. it thus isolates the rock program from the operating system, and runs it as a device program from the card. 3. html compliant engine 26 displays the input and output data. allows access only to the rock defined remote servers, with hidden url addresses. no trace of the url address of server pages delivered to the rock client left in the client machine. 4. dynamic pin encryptor 28 generates a dynamic 12 digit pin. the 4 digit pin is converted into a 12 digit dynamic pin by the pin encryption algorithm run from the client card. the dynamic pin so generated is based on the current standard server time, the ip of the client machine, the card serial number, its exe creation date and the user area code. the pin decryptor 40 is located at the server and uses a similar algorithm to decrypt the 12 digit pin and authenticate the user. 5. biometric & amp ; personal information bank 30 biometrics, such as photograph, signature, finger print, bank names & amp ; account nos. etc may be stored on the card. the details of such card - holder is indexed in databases located at one or more remote servers. 6. rock replication lock 32 although odd controller prevents the user from viewing, copying or editing the rock device data, this module makes it virtually impossible for a hacker to run the copied rock device program even if he manages to disable the odd controller functionality. the replication lock, works in the following manner. a ) the rock data on the optic disk card contains a unique virtual id, which cannot be copied over to any other data storage media. this virtual id is created while recording the original rock data at the time of creating the rock optical disc card. such virtual id is generated by marking a specific physical location on the rock optical disc card by means of a specific bit of data and its absolute location in terms of the precise positioning of the laser beam. in one embodiment this can be done by locating the innermost first data track and the outermost last data track of the rock od card incongruent with the iso 9660 standard specifications. these unique marks can be recorded for reference by the subcode channels during the recording session. as these data track markers will not be the same as on any other conventional cd, making a perfect copy will not be possible. b ) the rock replication lock algorithm checks for such virtual id before permitting the launch of the rock program. if the virtual id is missing, the rock program aborts the launch. in another simpler embodiment the rock program checks for information such as date of card creation, number of data tracks etc, before launching the program. nonconformance to these rock od card - specific marker data does not allow a duplicate cd to run the program. 7. optional biometric scanner & amp ; verifier 36 for added extra security the rock system can incorporate a real time biometric authentication module. description of many such biometric authentication systems are known to prior art and available as public domain. such module can be as simple as a signature pad input device, or much advanced as a finger print or body parts scanning device, for establishing the physical identification of the rock user, based on his unique biometric characteristics. the congregated effect of the above discussed algorithm modules of the rock system assigns the following properties to the odd and rock od card, which apparently transforms the odd into a rock reading device. 1. the user cannot view the rock program files using any conventional odd. 2. the user cannot copy the rock program files from the rock od card. 3. the user cannot run the rock program from any hard drive or any copied optical disc other than the original rock od card 4. the url address of pages delivered to rock application during the transaction are not displayed and permanently erased from all os and web browser engine buffers. 5. no program or unknown process is allowed to run concurrently during the rock transaction, thereby preventing any spy program from hijacking confidential user data. 6. the 4 - digit user pin is converted to 12 - digit dynamic pin, which changes with every transaction, hence accessing the rock server without the rock od card, even if the hacker cracks the user pin and url of the remote server, is virtually impossible, 7. every unauthorized transaction can be back tracked as the location and the client machine id is encrypted in the rock server database. in the preferred embodiment the user action is initiated at the client terminal by inserting the rock od card in the odd of the client machine and controlling the navigation with the help of the data input devices such as keyboard or mouse 34. for a very high level security a biometric scanner 36, such as signature or finger print scanner can be deployed for assuring a fool proof person specific transaction. the program algorithms on the rock od card are processed by the client cpu and displayed on its html compliant interface 38. through the html compliant interface the rock communicates with the rock server 12, which runs the dynamic pin decryption algorithm 40, for user access to the user info database 42, and access to predefined network servers 14. the user enters a 4 - digit pin 44 in a login page displayed in the html - compliant interface 38. on submission of the pin for user authentication, the dynamic pin encryptor 28 converts the pin to a 12 - digit number 46, which is generated by taking into account the time ( gmt from the server ) 48 and also the client location and machine id 50. the dynamic pin decryptor 40 of the authentication server 12 also generates the same dynamic pin using the same parameters. hence the dynamic pin changes with every login. if the 4 digit pin is correct the dynamic pin matches 52 and the user session is authenticated 54. [ 0053 ] fig3 a and 3 b illustrate the flow diagram of practical implementation of the preferred embodiment in terms of user navigation screens after the session is authenticated. thus, as illustrated in the above detailed description of the invention and the flow diagrams, an online transaction on the internet is secured by means of a physical hard key / card, which can universally work in any conventional computer without the need of a special hardware for reading such hard key / card. according to the teachings of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, such hard key / card will virtually eliminate unauthorized access and ensure a high level of security and privacy in all transactions conducted by using such hard key / card. a further feature of the preferred embodiment is the multiple layers of security built into the system, which makes it virtually impossible for a hacker to break in. even if the hacker is able to crack all the layers including the 4 - digit user pin, and succeeds in reaching the rock server without the rock od card, he will not be able to enter the server because only 12 - digit dynamic pin will be authenticated. such 12 - digit pin is generated afresh at every new transaction making it impossible to crack the 12 - digit dynamic pin. in another preferred embodiment of the present invention the security can be further enhanced by deploying biometric scanner for scanning physical characteristics of the user for access authentication. in yet another preferred embodiment the hard key / card is designed as a credit card, wherein the back of such a card has magnetic stripe and manual authentication methods, providing additional authentication methods in addition to odd based authentication. in yet another embodiment the hard key / card is deployed for authenticating login on to an assigned client computer. several embodiments of the present invention are specifically illustrated and described herein. however, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the present invention are covered by the above teachings. while the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in detail, it should be apparent that modifications and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the following claims.","the invention describes a novel method for securing authentic client access to online confidential resources by means of a physical hard key / card device , which does not need a custom card reader , but uses the optical disc drive of any remote computer to conduct a highly secure online transaction on the internet such real online card key device can be read by an optical disc drive of a computer , without allowing any of the file viewing , copying and editing functions . such rock device can be used as a real world physical hard key for accessing secured networks and conducting secure online transactions . it can also be used as a fully functional versatile credit card with additional magnetic stripe and manual authentication methods available on the non - reflective surface of the optical disc based rock optical disc card of the present invention ."
"an embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to fig1 through 3. referring to fig1 there is shown a robot 1 whose operation is controlled by a control apparatus 2. the control apparatus 2 comprises a taught - data memory section 3 for recording taught data for a work program, and a function control section 4 for commanding function processings such as general - purpose signal outputting, interlock signal waiting and so on. control apparatus 2 also includes a phase - angle control section 5 for processing and outputting the taught data in the taught - data memory section 3 in a predetermined manner, and a main control section 6 for organizing and controlling operational relationships between the taught - data memory section 3 and the function control section 4, and the phase - angle control section 5. additionally included in control apparatus 2 is a servo amplifying section 7 for amplifying the taught data outputted from the phase - angle control section 5 to drive the robot 1. the taught data recorded in the taught - data memory section 3 comprises position data and phase - angle data at each taught point. the phase - angle data is used in substitution for the conventional velocity data. the value of a taught phase angle i increases with the progress of the taught points. as shown in fig2 the phase - angle control section 5 comprises a cycle - time register 8 for setting beforehand a playback cycle time t c for the work program, and a phase - angle increment register 9 for setting therein a phase - angle increment c, which decreases with an increase in the playback cycle time t c. phase - angle control section 5 also includes an oscillator 10, a summing switch 11 driven by the oscillator 10, and a phase - angle register 12 for recording a reference phase angle r obtained by successive addition of the phase - angle increment c at each driving of the summing switch 11. phase - angle control section 5 additionally includes a comparator 13 for comparing a taught phase angle i in a step i among the taught data recorded in the taught - data memory section 3 with the reference phase angle r recorded in the phase - angle register 12 to output a signal when the reference phase - angle r exceeds the taught phase angle i. a gate 14 and a position - data output switch 15 are also included in phase - angle control section 5. gage 14 opens in response to the signal from the comparator 13 and outputs, to the servo amplifying section 7, taught - position data x i in the step i recorded in the taught - data memory section 3. the position - data output switch 15 is normally in an on position and usually outputs the signal from the comparator 13 to the gate 14. however, when function processings ( such as the previouslly - mentioned general - purpose signal outputting, interlock - signal awaiting, and so on ) are started at the function control section 4, the position - data output switch 15 is switched to an off position where transmission of the signal from the comparator 13 to the gate 14 is cut off to stop outputting of the taught - position data. further, the gate 14 opens in response to the signal from the comparator 13 to output the position data x i in the step i and, simultaneously therewith, the signal from the comparator 13 is inputted into a step counter 16 in the main control section 6, to update the numerical value of the counter from i to i + 1. the data memory section 3, thereupon selects the taught data in the step i + 1. in the embodiment shown, in which the oscillator 10 is utilized to drive the summing switch 11, the phase - angle increment c set in the phase - angle increment register 9 is obtained by the equation set forth below. in this equation, t c ( in seconds ) is the playback cycle time set in the cycle - time register 8. cy ( in degrees ) is the phase angle of one cycle recorded in the taught - data memory section 3, ( that is, the phase angle at the final taught point ), and a ( in hz ) is frequency of the oscillator 10 : further, since the phase - angle increment c is added at a period corresponding to the frequency of the oscillator 10, that is, a rate of once per 1 / a seconds, the advance velocity of the reference phase angle r is cy / t c. specifically, the reference phase angle r increases at the advance velocity, which decreases with an increases in the playback cycle time t c of the work program, the playback cycle time t c being set beforehand. the operation of the embodiment will next be described with reference to an example of an actual work programs as illustrated in fig3. in this example, an automotive body 21 is conveyed by a first conveyor 20, a windshield 23 is conveyed by a second conveyor 22, and the robot 1 mounts the windshield 23 on to the automotive body 21. the first and second conveyors 20 and 22 are asynchronous with each other and also slightly vary in the cycle time. when the automotive body 21 and window glass 23 arrive at the robot station, respective arrival signals are outputted to the control apparatus 2 for the robot 1. first, the work program is taught. to this end, the position data and the phase angle are taught at each teaching point on an operation path of the work program. in this example, there are first through thirteenth teaching points p 1 through p 13. the taught phase angle at the first teaching point p 1, that is, at the original position, is 0. the taught phase angle at the subsequent second teaching point p 2 is 30. the taught phase angle also increases by 30 for each subsequent teaching point along the operation path. the arrival of the windshield 23 conveyed by the second conveyor 22 is awaited at the third teaching point p 3, which has its phase angle of 60. when the windshield 23 arrives, the robot 1 receives it and, subsequently, awaits the arrival of the automotive body 21 at the eighth teaching point p 8, which has a phase angle of 210. when the automotive body 21 arrives, the windshield 23 is mounted on the body 21, and the robot 1 is again returned to the thirteenth teaching point p 13, having a phase angle of 360, that is, to the original position. subsequently, the desired playback cycle time t c is set in the cycle - time register 8 illustrated in fig2. at this time, simultaneously with the setting of t c, the phase - angle increment c in accordance with the aforesaid equation c = cy / ( t c a ) is set in the phase - angle increment register 9. the taught work program can then be played back. when the start of a playback work cycle is instructed or commanded by the main control section 6, the summing switch 11 is driven at the frequency of the oscillator 10. the phase - angle increment c set in the register 9 is added repeatedly. the reference phase angle r is recorded in the phase - angle register 12. the advance velocity of the reference phase angle r at this time is cy / t c as mentioned previously. on the other hand, the numerical value of the step counter 16 is first returned to 1. the taught data in the step 1, that is, the taught data of the original position p 1, is selected at the taught - data memory section 3. the taught phase angle of the taught data is outputted to the comparator 13, and the position data is outputted to the gate 14. at the comparator 13, the taught phase angle 0 of the step 1 is compared with the reference phase angle r recorded in the phase - angle register 12, so that the gate 14 instantaneously opens to output the taught position data of the step 1 to the servo amplifying section 7. simultaneously with this, the numerical value of the step counter 16 is updated to 2, so that the step in the taught - data memory section 3 is advanced to 2. thus, the taught data at the second teaching point p 2 is outputted. that is, the taught phase angle of 30 is outputted to the comparator 13. the reference phase angle r recorded in the register 12 increases at the aforementioned advance velocity cy / t c. when the reference phase angle r exceeds 30, the gate 14 opens in response to the signal from the comparator 13. thus, the position data at the second teaching point p 2 is outputted to the servo amplifying section 7. by doing so, the robot 1 moves to the taught position in synchronism with the advance velocity cy / t c of the reference phase angle r. subsequently, the numerical value of the step counter 16 is updated to 3. the step in the taught - data memory section 3 proceeds to 3, so that the taught data at the third teaching point p 3 is outputted. that is, the taught phase angle of 60 is outputted to the comparator 13. when the reference phase angle exceeds 60 in the same manner as described above, the taught - position data is outputted to the servo amplifying section 7, so that the robot 1 moves to the taught position. simultaneously with this, the step in the taught - data memory section 3 advances by 1, so that the taught data at the fourth teaching point p 4 is outputted. on the other hand, the robot 1 at this time is in the position of the third teaching point p 3, that is, in the position where the taught phase angle is 60. accordingly, if the windshield 23 conveyed by the second conveyor 22 has not arrived at the robot station, the arrival signal is not outputted. thus, an off signal in the course of function execution is outputted from the function control section 4, so that the position - data output switch 15 is turned off. while the position - data output switch 15 is turned off, the signal from the comparator 13 is cut off, so that outputting of the position data is stopped. when the windshield 23 arrives at the robot station and the arrival signal is outputted, the off signal from the function control section 4 is nullified. thus, the position - data output switch 15 is returned to the on position. by doing so, the position data at the fourth teaching point p 4 is outputted to the servo amplifying section 7, so that the robot 1 is again operated. in connection with the above, during the time the position - data output switch 15 is turned off, the reference phase angle r recorded in the phase - angle register 12 continues to increase. if the reference phase angle r at the time the position - data output switch 15 is returned to the on position exceeds the 120 taught phase angle at the fifth teaching point p 5, the position data at the fourth and fifth teaching points p 4 and p 5 are outputted successively to the servo amplifying section 7 through the gate 14, simultaneously with the return of the position - data output switch 15 to the on position. by doing so, even if the windshield 23 arrives late and the start of the operation of the robot is delayed, it is possible to recover from the delay. subsequently, the above - described operation is repeated on the sixth through thirteenth teaching points p 6 through p 13, so that the robot 1 is operated at a velocity in synchronism with the advance velocity of the reference phase angle r. at the position of the eighth teaching point p 8 ( having a phase angle of 210 ), if the automotive body 21 conveyed by the first conveyor 20 has not yet arrived at the robot station, an off signal is outputted from the function control section 4 in a manners similar to that previously discussed with respect to the third teaching point p 3 with the phase angle 60. thus, the position - data output switch 15 is turned off, and the signal from the comparator 13 is cut off while the position - data output switch 15 is turned off, so that outputting of the position data is stopped. after the automotive body 21 has arrived, the position signal is outputted. the embodiment is constructed as described above. accordingly, the robot 1 moves in synchronism with the advance velocity cy / t c of the reference phase angle r. further, the position data is outputted in synchronism with the advance velocity of the reference phase angle r, even if the operation of the robot is delayed. thus, it is possible to recover from the delay. consequently, it is possible to operate the robot 1 at the playback cycle time t c set beforehand, and it is possible to administer the work cycle time. moreover, if the value of the playback cycle time is altered, the phase - angle increment c changes, so that the advance velocity cy / t c of the reference phase angle r changes. accordingly, it is possible to freely alter the cycle time of the robot operation, depending upon date or time, or types or kinds of work, without modification of the taught data. furthermore, the alteration of the cycle time is possible even in the course of playback. in connection with the above, in the embodiment, in order to calculate or compute the reference phase angle r ( which increases at the advance velocity, the advance velocity itself decreasing with an increase in the playback cycle time t c, which is set beforehand ), the phase - angle increment c ( which decreases with an increase in the playback cycle time t c ) is obtained from the playback cycle time t c, the phase angle cy of one entire work cycle and the oscillation frequency a, and the phase - angle increment c is added at the frequency of the oscillator 10. however, similar results can be obtained if a constant value is set as the phase - angle increment, and if the oscillation frequency of the oscillator 10 driving the summation switch 11 is controlled such that the oscillation frequency decreases with an increase in the playback cycle time t c. according to the invention, the playback operation of the robot is done in synchronism with the advance velocity of the reference phase angle, and the position data is outputted in synchronism with the advance velocity of the reference phase angle even if the operation of the robot is delayed. accordingly, it is possible to recover from a delay, and it is possible to operate the robot at a playback cycle time set beforehand. in addition, if setting of the playback cycle time is altered, the advance velocity of the reference phase angle changes. thus, it is possible to freely alter the cycle time of the robot operation without modification of the taught data.","a robot control method of the playback type and an apparatus for using the method in which position data and data regarding velocity are taught at a sequence of points for a work program , and a servo system is driven by the use of the taught data to playback or repeat the work program . phase angles which increase as the robot progresses through the sequence of teaching points are taught as the data regarding the velocity of the work program . at playback , a reference phase angle computed on the basis of a previously -

"fig1 is a stylized top view of a guided vehicle 2 driving in the direction of the arrow 4 toward a magnet 6 that is mounted in the floor. the vehicle 2 has drive wheels 8, 10 on the left and right sides respectively, which are powered individually by motors that are not shown. caster 12, 14, 16 and 18 support the vehicle at its left - front, left - rear, right - front and right - rear corners respectively. the terms left, right, front and back are used here for convenience of description ; the vehicle operates symmetrically in either direction. touch - sensitive feelers or bumpers 20, 22 are located at the front and back of the vehicle respectively to detect obstacles in the path and to activate switches to stop the vehicle. a transversely arranged linear array of magnetic sensors 24 is mounted on the vehicle as shown in fig1. in fig2 a floor magnet 6 is shown in place in a hole 32 in the floor. the magnet in this embodiment is cylindrical, placed with its axis vertical, and has its south - polarized face 34 facing upward and its north - polarized face 36 at the bottom o the hole. the diameter of the magnet in this embodiment is 1 inch and its axial height is 3 / 4 inch. the array 24 of magnetic - field sensors in shown in plan view in fig3. in this embodiment it comprises twenty - four hall - effect sensors spaced for example 0. 8 inch apart in a straight line perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle and laterally centered on the centerline of the vehicle. the first sensor is labeled 37 ; the twelfth sensor is 48 ; the thirteenth sensor is 49 and the twenty - fourth sensor is 60. the sensors are commercially available devices whose analog output voltage varies as a function of the magnetic field it detects. each sensor has a null voltage, which is its output when no magnetic field is present. when a magnetic field is present the voltage consistently increases or decreases relative to the center of flux of the magnet and to the null voltage, depending upon whether the magnet crosses a south or north pole. in the described embodiment of the invention the sensors always detect a south pole field 34, so their output voltage always increases as a result of being near a magnet. a representative graph 64 of the analog output voltage versus distance of a sensor from the center of the magnet 6 is shown in fig4. voltage output from the hall sensor ( such as sensor 45, for example ) is shown on the ordinate 62, in volts. the distance from the center of the magnet to the sensor is shown on the abscissa 61 in inches. for the measurement shown, the graph has a depressed zero and the output voltage in the absence of any magnetic field is the null voltage 66 of about 6. 44 volts. in this measurement, when the sensor 45 is directly over the center of the magnet the analog output voltage is approximately 7. 1 volts. when the sensor 45 is approximately one inch away from the center of the magnet 6 the analog output voltage 64 produced by the sensor is approximately 6. 65 volts. thus, two magnets which are more than four inches apart, but sufficiently close to be simultaneously sensed, produce detectable signals which are essentially independent. signals from the twenty - four hall sensors of array 24 are input at terminals 68, 69 to a pair of ganged multiplexers 70, 71, as shown in fig5. the multiplexers 70, 71 receive analog signals continuously from the twenty - four sensors 37 - 60, and select one at a time sequentially for output at line 72. the two output signals from the multiplexers are connected to a signal - conditioning circuit 74 whose functions are explained in more detail below. its output at line 76 is connected to an analog - to - digital converter ( a / d ) 78 whose output comprises eight digital lines 80 that conduct digital signals to a microcontroller 82. output data from the microcontroller 82 are in serial form differential output at a line 84, which conducts the data through a communication chip 85 and differential output lines 87, therefrom, to a communication board, not shown. a control bus 86 enables the microcontroller 82 to control multiplexers 70, 71 and the a / d converter 78 as described more fully below. more details of the electronic circuits on the vehicle are shown in fig6 and 6a - d. in combination, fig6 a - d comprise a single circuit layout, numbered in clockwise rotation and divided as seen in fig6. interconnections among fig6 a - d comprise twenty - four lines between fig6 a and 6b, six lines between fig6 b and 6c, and four lines between 6c and 6d. the lines between 6a and 6b comprise twenty four sensor inputs 68, 69. interconnections between 6b and 6c comprise five lines, generally designated 114, and line 16. lines 84, 84 & # 39 ;, 114 & # 39 ;

an average is computed for each sensor alone. because the sensor outputs vary with temperature the null voltage is remeasured ( updated ) for all of the sensors after each time that a magnet is traversed. this reduces errors that otherwise might result from differences in temperature along a vehicle & # 39 ; s path. a simplified description of the program of fig7 starts at a flow line 120. in block 122 the null voltages of the sensors 37 - 60 are measured. to do this the microprocessor 82 of fig6 a - d address the first sensor by way of multiplexers 70, 71. the signal from the first sensor passes across line 72 to the difference amplifier 94 and the a / d converter 78, thence to the microprocessor 82, fig6 a - d, where it is temporarily stored. returning to fig7 in block 122 the multiplexers 70, 71 then measure the null voltage of the second sensor, etc. until all sensors have been measured. the entire sequence is then repeated several times in block 122, starting again with the first sensor. in block 124 all of the null readings of the first sensor are averaged and in block 126 the average value of null readings of the first sensor is stored. this averaging and storing process is performed for all twenty - four of the sensors. after the null voltages have been stored the program goes into a wait loop 128. in the wait loop the microprocessor 82 continuously polls each sensor 37 - 60 to determine whether or not a signal level in excess of a predetermined threshold level exists, which would indicate the presence of a magnet nearby. details of the wait - loop are as follows. block 130 shows the polling of sensor signals. in block 132 the previously stored null voltage corresponding to each sensor is subtracted from the signal output of that sensor to obtain a difference signal, representing the strength of a magnetic field. in the block 134 the difference signal is tested to ascertain whether or not it exceeds a predetermined threshold level, which is set so as to differentiate between noise and true magnetic marker signals. if the difference signal is below the threshold level the wait - loop routine is repeated. in another preferred embodiment, the program flow of which is seen in fig8 the averaging and storing process is continued through a wait loop 128 & # 39 ;. in this embodiment, a running average of each null voltage is calculated in block 150 by the following equation : j represents the figure number of a selected sensor ( i. e. j = 37 thru 60 ). n j ( t ) is the average measurement of each null voltage at time t for sensor j. k 1 is an integer multiplier which determines the time or sample by sample weighting of past and present measurements on the current running average voltage calculation. ( k 1 may be on the order of 100. ) n j ( t - 1 ) is the average measurement of each null voltage at the previous sample or time t - 1 for sensor j. r j ( t ) is the raw voltage measurement of the voltage at time t for sensor j. when a difference signal is found to exceed the predetermined threshold level, the null voltage calculation is terminated. all other program functions in wait - loop 128 & # 39 ; are the same as those of wait - loop 128. if the difference signal is large enough, block 136 stores the difference signal. it then finds the sensor having the greatest such difference signal and the sensor having the second greatest. the program of microprocessor 82 identifies the two closest sensors on the left side of the sensor that has the greatest difference signal, and the two closest sensors on the right side of the sensor that have the greatest difference signal, in block 138. thus a group of five sensors is defined. the program then refers in block 140 to a lookup table that is stored in its memory to determine the distance to the magnet from each sensor, based on the magnitude of the signal received from the sensor. two tables, as shown by example below, relate the voltage measured by each sensor ( 37 - 60 ) to the absolute distance to the center of magnet 6. table 1 is a lookup table comprising voltages measured at incremental distances by a sensor ( 37 - 60 ) from a magnet 6. table 2 is a table providing the actual distances from the sensor to the center of the magnetic field as derived from currently used sensors ( 37 - 60 ) and magnet field strength. relative table 1 table 2memory location ( measured voltage ) ( radial distance ) 0 142 raw adc units 0. 0 inches 1 139 0. 0941 2 133 0. 1882 3 124 0. 2823 4 112 0. 3764 5 99 0. 4705 6 85 0.

of looking up the distance from the sensor to the magnet is performed by the microprocessor 82, and is represented by the block 140 of fig7 and 8. the five selected sensors are denoted by s i ( where i = - 2 to 2 ) and the center sensor or sensor having the greatest measured voltage is s 0. before a search is made to correlate each measured voltage with the related distance to the center of magnetic flux, the stored null voltage, n j, is subtracted from the currently derived raw signal from each sensor ( 37 - 60 ) to provide a search variable, e i, devoid of the null offset error as shown in the following equation : a sequential search through table 1 is performed for each search variable e i each time the group of five sensors is sampled. to determine the distance from each selected sensor ( s - 2, - 1, 0, 1, 2 ) to the center of magnetic flux, the table is searched until the difference between the value in table 1 and the search variable changes sign. when the sign change occurs, the search variable is determined to be between the last and next - to - last table 1 value used. an interpolation variable, i, is next calculated as follows : k is the relative memory position of the last table 1 value used. t k represents the table 1 value at relative memory position k. t k - 1 represents the table 1 value at relative memory position k - 1. r k - 1 represents the table 2 value at relative memory position at k - 1. the radial distance, d i, from each sensor to the center of flux of magnet 6 is then calculated as : to calculate the position of the center of flux of magnet 6 from a common fixed point, such as array end 160, on the array 24, each d i is treated as a lateral vector, the sign of which is determined by its position relative to sensors having the greatest and second greatest difference signals as herebefore related. the position of the center of flux of magnet 6 from the common fixed point 160 is then calculated by adding or subtracting each d i depending upon the sign of the vector to or from linear distance l i of each sensor from array end 160 as shown in the following equation : a further correction may be made to relate the center of flux of magnet 6 to the centerline 164 of vehicle 2 by adding a constant which represents the distance from fixed point 160 on array 24 to centerline 164 of vehicle 2. see fig3. in block 144 an average is taken of the five estimates of the location 145 of the magnet with respect to the centerline 59 of the vehicle. one estimate is available from each of the five sensors of the group ( having asterisks in fig3 ) whose middle one is the sensor of strongest signal. in this example, sensor 45 is s 0, sensor 43 is s - 2, sensor 44 is s - 1, sensor 46 is s 1, and sensor 47 is s 2. after each of the five sensors have been sampled, an average estimate of the position, x t, of the center of flux of magnet 6 is calculated as shown below : c is the distance 162 from the distance from fixed point 160 on array 24 to the centerline 164 of vehicle 2. the accuracy of measurement is further ameliorated by a running average of the successively measured values of x t. though other equations may be used to calculate the running average, the following equation is employed in the currently preferred embodiment : x ( t ) is the running average of the measurement of the center of flux of magnet 6 for the series of five sensors measured at time t and related to the centerline 164 of vehicle 2. x ( t - 1 ) is the previous running average of the measurement of the center of flux of magnet 6 for the series of five sensors measured at time t - 1 and related to the centerline 164 of vehicle 2. k 2 is the filter or decay constant for the running average. k 2 is on the order of three in the currently preferred embodiment. as one familiar with computer addressing would know, the values of measured voltages for table 1 need not be derived from incremental distances, but only from measurements taken at known, regularly increasing or decreasing distances which are then stored in the related memory location in table 2. new and useful tables 1 and 2 may be generated for combinations of sensors and magnets which yield different voltage versus distance values by measuring the voltage as a function of distance for the new combination. as seen in table 2, in the above example, the radial distances stored in incremental memory locations are even multiples of 0. 0941 inches. the next program function, performed in block 142, is to determine whether or not the peak of sensor voltage has been passed. the peak values of output voltage from the hall sensors of array 24 occur when the array 24 is directly over the floor - mounted magnet 6. when the reading of the sensors start to decline the array of sensors has passed over the center of flux of magnet 6. this condition is detected by block 142 by conventional programming. the combination of precalibrating each sensor prior to measurement to take out the offsetting null voltage and averaging and calculating a running average until the peak voltage is reached provides a measurement of significantly improved accuracy. the accuracy of the lateral position measurement 145 is 0. 02 inch. the process of selecting a group of sensors, looking up distances and averaging them is a form of cross - correlation of received signals with a store field pattern. this result is transmitted, block 146, from the microprocessor 82 to a main microprocessor, not shown. it is transmitted promptly when the peak readings are detected, so the time of transmission of the data serves as a indication of the time at which the sensor array 24 crosses the marker magnet 6. in this way both lateral and longitudinal position information are obtained from one passage of the array 24 over magnet 6. data from block 146 is transmitted to the main microprocessor board. the program, at point 148, then returns to the starting program flow line 120 of fig7 and 8. another embodiment having two arrays of sensors such as array 24 is also feasible. reference is now made to fig9 - 11, wherein a second preferred embodiment is seen. in the second embodiment, two magnets 6, 6 & # 39 ; are placed in sufficiently close proximity that magnetic flux from each of magnets 6, 6 & # 39 ; is sensed by a plurality of sensors 37 - 60 concurrently, yet separation 163 of magnets 6, 6 & # 39 ; is sufficient to permit independent processing of signals derived from each magnet 6 or 6 & # 39 ;. as seen in fig1, exemplary path 157 of the center of flux of one magnet 6 is the same as the path described in fig3. a second path 257 is seen for second magnet 6 & # 39 ;. the table below summarizes the results of signals derived from two concurrently measured magnetic paths 157, 257, showing the assumed greatest signal level sensed for each magnet, next highest level and sensors active for the measurement of position of each magnet ( indicated by a single asterisk ( * ) for magnet 6 and a double asterisk ( * * ) for magnet 6 & # 39 ; ) : relative sensor first magnet ( 6 ) second magnet ( 6 & # 39 ; )

determining the position of the vehicle relative to each magnet 6, 6 & # 39 ;. fig9 shows the orientation of fig9 a relative to fig9 b. program flow line 120 connects the output of block 252 in fig9 b to start in fig9 a. program flow line 220 connects the & # 34 ; yes & # 34 ; output of block 260 in fig9 b to continue in fig9 a. program flow line 222 connects the & # 34 ; yes & # 34 ; output of block 254 and the & # 34 ; no & # 34 ; output of block 142 of fig9 a to start 2 in fig9 b. as before described, the null offsets are calculated during a known null period as specified in blocks 122, 124, and 126. as earlier described, in fig8 a wait loop 128 & # 39 ; provides an updating of the null calibration for each of the sensors until an over threshold measurement indicates detection of magnetic flux of a first magnet 6 or 6 & # 39 ;. upon such detection as part of block 236 activity, the sensor values are stored and the sensor having the strongest signal is selected as earlier described for block 136 in fig7. in addition in block 236, a first sensor group active flag is set to signal a first magnet position measurement is active. as earlier described, the activities of blocks 138, 140, and 144 select the group of sensors used in the calculation of what is now the first sensor group, interpolate the distance from each sensor of the first group to the center of magnetic flux of the first detected magnet and average, then calculate a running average of the position of the vehicle relative to the magnet. decision block 142 branches to a block 146 & # 39 ; when the peak value of the first sensed signal is detected or to a second path headed by start 2 before the peak is discovered. at start 2, input program flow line 222 leads to decision block 224 wherein a decision is made whether or not a second group active flag is set indicating a signal has previously been detected from a second magnet. if the second group flag is not set, a single pass through blocks 230, 232, and 234 is made. blocks 230, 232, and 234 comprise programming functions which are similar to those described for blocks 130, 132, and 134, except blocks 230, 232, and 234 only process information related to sensors of array 24 not involved with the first group. if no threshold is detected in block 234, an updated null calibration is calculated for each sensor which is not part of the first group and a branch is made to continue to merge with program flow line 220. if a signal above threshold is detected, a branch is made to block 336 wherein the appropriate signal values are stored and processed as in block 136 for a second group of sensors and the second group active flag is set. the program proceeds directly from block 336 to block 238. if the second group active flag is set upon entry at program flow line 222, a branch is made directly to block 238 therefrom. sequentially, blocks 238, 240, and 244 perform the same functions upon data received from sensors of the second group as blocks 138, 140, and 144 perform upon data received from sensors of the first group. decision block 242 determines whether or not a signal peak, as before described, has been reached. if not, the process continues to decision block 260. if so, measured position values, as derived from both magnets 6 and 6 & # 39 ;, are transmitted to the main processor for use in navigation and guidance updating, the first and second group active flags are reset as shown in block 252. from block 252, the logic path proceeds to start at program flow line 120 to repeat the function preliminary to the search for one or more additional magnets along the vehicle & # 39 ; s path. from decision block 260, a branch is made to block 238 if the first group active flag is reset indicating a peak has been detected for the first measured magnetic field. if the first group active flag is set, the program proceeds to program flow line 220 whereat block 138 is entered to subsequently process the output of the first group of sensors dedicated to making a measurement of the position of the first detected magnetic field. if within block 142 a peak voltage is detected, the programs proceeds to block 146 & # 39 ; wherein the measured position determined by first group measurements are stored for later recovery and transmission to the main processor and the first group active flag is reset. from block 16 & # 39 ;, decision block 254 is entered, wherein a branch is made to proceed to start 2 through program flow line 222 if the second group active flag is set or to proceed to block 256 if the second group active flag is reset. at block 256, only the first group measured position is reported based upon only one magnetic field having been detected and no concurrent measurement having been made. although the invention has been illustrated by describing only one particular preferred embodiment, its scope is not limited to that embodiment, but rather is determined by the claims.","an improved accuracy position and direction updating system for use with an automatic guided vehicle that navigates by dead reckoning . permanent magnets providing

"tester overall timing accuracy ( ota ) is defined as : aggregate timing error comprised of input edge placement accuracy, output edge placement accuracy and input to output timing accuracy. see, for example, semi draft document # 2928, s pecification for overall digital timing accuracy, section 7. 1 ( semi g79 - 0200 s pecification for o verall d igital t iming a ccuracy, semiconductor equipment & amp ; materials international, mountain view, calif., 7. 1, five pages ). the tester & # 39 ; s strobe edge distribution inside that window is a function of the tester architecture. the dut valid data window ( dut propagation delay ) is a physical parameter that has a certain distribution as a function of the fabrication process and the design. fig1 illustrates that distribution as a gaussian bell curve ( normally distributed propagation delay with a certain ). the mean of the dut propagation delay is defined as _ dut, relative to the tester timing reference ( t 0 ). the absolute limit ( al ), is the maximum acceptable time for the data to be valid. any transitions occurring to the right of al are outside of the specification requirements ( that is, a bad part relative to the specific speed requirement ). the challenge is to program the tester to the optimum limits. in the case of a perfect tester ( ota = 0 ps ), the test limit is set to the spec limit ( al ). the tester strobe edge is not a perfect parameter ; it has its own uncertainty region, as wide as the tester & # 39 ; s overall tester accuracy ( ota ). in reality, the test engineer needs to apply guard - bands for the tester uncertainty area. program strobe ( ps ) is the timing value which the tester edge strobe is programmed for. note, that the area between al and the left edge ( le ) of the tester uncertainty box represents a probability zone for a good part ( faster than al ) to be misjudged by the tester, as the tester compare edge can be more aggressive than al. this is considered a yield loss. yield loss is inherently a function of the width of the uncertainty area. to calculate the probability of such an event, we use conditional probability ( see equations in appendix b ). the hashed area between al and the right side ( rs ) of the uncertainty box for the tester edge reflects a probability zone for bad parts ( parts with propagation delay longer than the allowed limit ), escaping through as passed parts ( since the tester edge strobe might land to the right of the actual edge ). these escapes are measured in defect per millions ( dpm ). an acceptable value for such released defect rate depends on the actual part value and its usage. the more expensive the end application is, the more costly dpms are for the customer. note that shifting the test limit to the right ( looser guard - banding ) means less yield loss, but increases the dpm value. the tester edge placement accuracy translates into the uncertainty box width. the wider the uncertainty area is ( lower tester accuracy ) the bigger the losses are ( in terms of yield and dpm ). the purpose of applying a guard - band to a parameter being tested, is to minimize escapes due to tester edge placement inaccuracy. a common method for guard - band is to apply tighter test limits by the ota value. this in theory moves the tester uncertainty box to the left, as the programmed strobe gets tighter, narrowing the probability of escapes to zero, at the expense of yield. assuming the dut delay is normally distributed, x _ dut n ( _ dut, 2 _ dut ), there are two parameters to evaluate : _ dut the average delay, and 2 _ dut the process variance. the average is normalized to be zero, and all parameters referenced to it. to estimate the variance we use the expected process yield to fit a curve and estimate the amount of parts lost due to real performance failures ( not test issues ). fig2 is a plot showing dut edge timing distribution and expected yield, in which the dut delay x _ dut n ( _ dut, 2 _ dut ) and the probability density function of x _ dut is f ( x ), where _ dut is the average delay, and ( 2 _ dut is the process variance. duts having dut delays outside the limits of a. l and + a. l are yield losses, as shown in fig2. we model the tester edge to be normally distributed within the ota window. as ate specs guarantee that the tester edge lands inside the ota window, the gaussian function gets cut at the edges. inside the ota region, we assume the dut gaussian distribution has a variance _ tester : note that this translates into probability of & lt ; 1 % for the tester edge to get out of the combined uncertainty box ( + / ota wide ). in reality, any tester pin that falls outside of the ota window is replaced with a better one to guarantee the tester accuracy specs across all pins. appendix a outlines the relation between tester ota and the clock and data edge placement accuracy ( epa ). fig3 is a series of plots showing the impact of tester accuracy on yield. fig3 shows the actual yields achieved due to tester accuracy as a function of the tester ota. note that the better the accuracy ( smaller ota ), the closer the yield gets to the ideal yield. the ideal yield is set by the process, and its maturity. we chose the ideal yield to be 95 % for the above simulation, and absolute limits to be tq ( table 1 at 800 mbps ). the plots show different dpm points as well. tighter dpm requirements mean more severe yield impact. in high speed digital parts ( high - speed digital semiconductor components ), the key timing parameters are : propagation delay ( specified in rambus specifications as tq see for example table 21 and fig5 of d irect rdram p reliminary i nformation, d ocument dl0035, version 1. 0, rambus inc. ) and setup and hold times ( specified as tsh ). the two parameters are sensitive to tester accuracy. tq is defined as ctm - to - data output limit, i. e., the valid window for rambus signal level ( rsl ) outputs relative to the internal clock ctm ( see fig4 ). fig4 illustrates the rambus timing tq definition. the simulation we used focuses on tq. however, the same can be applied for tsh. as tsh for 800 mbps data rate is even tighter than tq ( latest tsh spec is + / 200 ps ), the model results here are conservative. following the previously explained procedure, we can estimate the actual yields resulting from different testers accuracy. as the expected yields of rdram parts at 800 mbps are not clear yet, we strobe the yield impact at different points. ideal yield is expected to go up with time as rambus manufacturing process and design mature. limiting the dpm to be 300 ( an acceptable value in most pc applications ), we can plot the yield loss as a function of the tester accuracy ( table 2 ). currently rambus speeds are : 800 mbps and 600 mbps. parts that fail at 800 mbps can be retested against the 600 mbps specifications. apparently, missing the 800 mbps performance due to tester accuracy means lower premium on these parts. the probability calculation needs to be conditioned to the fact that there is another tester edge with a new distribution : to translate the above numbers into dollars, we add two new parameters to the equation : device average selling price ( asp ). asp value can be either the market value for an 800 mbps rdram part, or the price premium between the two speeds. to be conservative, we shall assume a price premium of $ 5 between bin 800 mbps and bin 600 mbps. we also assume that all the parts that fail 800 mbps, pass the 600 mbps speed test. cost of escapes : this depends on the actual end application. we won & # 39 ; t be able to quantify the escapes impact in dollars, but we will limit the escapes to 300 dpm. for an ideal yield of 95 %, the yield enhancement between testers with a 60 ps ota difference ( 160 ps vs 100 ps ) was calculated to be 14. 1 % ( see bold values in table 2 ). with the forecasted high volumes for the rdrams in the coming future, this yield difference translates into major profit difference. for a 100 million parts produced annually, savings of 14 % in yield mean savings of $ 70m. that is a value of $ 1. 1m for every added pico - second of tester accuracy. the parameters of this example are summarized in the user interface display of fig1 showing input parameters and output results in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. a different way to look at the numbers is by estimating the savings per tester. assuming a tester output to be 10 million parts annually ( a typical volume for a memory tester with : 60 sec test time, 32 parts in parallel and 60 % utilization ), a single tester with 60 ps added accuracy can more than pay for itself in one year. better tester accuracy translates into better yield and dpm. a model was given to estimate the potential improvements on both ends, with enhancements to accommodate double binning for the rambus two proposed speeds ( 600 mbps and 800 mbps ). for the forecasted rambus asps, it was shown that every 1 ps of better tester accuracy means an added $ 1. 1m to the bottom line on a 100 million parts volume. besides the ota, ate manufacturers use the term : edge placement accuracy ( epa ) for specifying timing accuracy. a single pin edge can have an error of + / epa from its programmed value. for a propagation delay measurement tpd, the two errors need to be considered : clock input epa ( epa1 ), and data output measurement error ( epa2 ). if the clock input happens at + epa1 from its programmed value, and the output edge search has an error of + epa2, the measurement would give tpd + ( epa1 + epa2 ). on the other hand, if the clock input lands at epa1, while the output edge search has an error of epa2, the measurement will result in tpd ( epa1 + epa2 ). therefore, the total error width of such a measurement is + / ( epa1 + epa2 ). the total error was defined earlier as ota. apparently, improving the clock accuracy ( epa1 ) can easily improve the overall tester accuracy and reduce losses as shown in the description above : for a propagation delay parameter tpd, a good part means its edge transition happens faster than the maximum delay allowed. the equations below outline that case. in rambus specification however, tq is specified with min and max limits, requiring limits for both ends. in the model, we used two sided limits as well. ideal yield ( i. y ) = p ( good ) = p ( dut edge & lt ; absolute limit ) = - absolutelimit f ( x _ dut ) x _ dut ( b. 3 ) actual yield ( a. y ) = p ( dut edge & lt ; tester edge ) = - g ( x _ tester ) - x _ tester f ( x _ dut ) x _ dut x _ tester ( b. 4 ) yield loss ( y. l ) = p ( tester edge & lt ; dut edg & lt ; absolute limit ) = - absolutelimit g ( x _ tester ) x _ tester absolutlimit f ( x _ dut ) x _ dut x _ tester ( b. 5 ) dpm = p ( absolute limit & lt ; dut edge & lt ; tester edge absolute limit ) / ( actual yield ) = absolutelimit g ( x _ tester ) absolutelimit x _ tester f ( x _ dut ) x _ dut x _ tester actualyield the accuracy model was implemented using visual basic and excel micro. it involved numerical calculation of integration and parameter solving. fig5 outlines the flow chart of an algorithm implemented in accordance with the invention. the exemplary flow chart of fig5 provides for calculation of yields as follows : step 510 : set input parameters : ideal yield ( i. y ), absolute limit ( a. l ), acceptable step 515 : create a gaussian curve : n ( 0, _ dut ), calculate _ dut to meet ideal step 535 : change test limit, then return to step 525 those of skill in the art will recognize that the method described provides a quantifiable measure of the relationship between tester edge placement accuracy and manufacturing cost of semiconductor devices under test. a sample case with rambus rdram devices is presented, though the method is applicable to other devices as well. data rates are estimated where accuracy matters. as shown in fig6 dut propagation delay ( t _ dut ) is a physical parameter that has a certain distribution. tester strobe edge location ( t _ ate ) has an uncertainty region measured by overall tester accuracy ( ota ). fig7 illustrates the dut edge probability, yield loss and dpm for a typical ota. fig8 illustrates the dut edge probability, yield loss and dpm for an ota which is less than that of fig7. a comparison of fig7 and 8 shows that lower tester accuracy means a wider tester - edge - uncertainty box, which means higher yield loss and higher dpm. loosening the test limit moves the tester - edge - uncertainty box to the right, producing higher yield but increased dpm. fig9 graphically illustrates with plots of yield loss vs. dpm, assuming two different edge - placement - accuracy values. as shown in the examples of fig9 both yield loss and dpm improve with better edge - placement accuracy. fig1 shows a plot of dut edge - placement probability relative to timing specification limit. devices performing within the spec limit are within the process expected yield ; those performing outside the spec limit are considered yield loss. for dut modeling, dut timing ( propagation delay ) is normally distributed across the silicon process tpd n ( _ dut, _ dut ) ; _ dut = 0. dut expected yield based on the specific timing parameter determines the process distribution _ dut. tester edge placement can be modeled as shown in fig1, wherein : tester - edge - placement distribution model is normal : t _ program _ strobe n ( _ ate, _ ate ) within the uncertainty window of width ( 2 ota ) fig1 illustrates the impact of accuracy on yield as a result of increased data rates. the plots assume propagation delay tpd is at 20 % ratio from tui [ tq : tui = 260 ps : 1. 25 ns ]. an embodiment of the invention can be implemented as computer software in the form of computer readable code executed on a general purpose computer such as computer 100 illustrated in fig1. a keyboard 110 and mouse 111 are coupled to a bidirectional system bus 118. the keyboard and mouse are for introducing user input to the computer system and communicating that user input to processor 113. other suitable input devices may be used in addition to, or in place of, the mouse 111 and keyboard 110. input - output ( i / o ) units 119 coupled to bidirectional system bus 118 represents such i / o elements as a printer, audio / video ( a / v ) input / output devices, etc. computer 100 includes a video memory 114, main memory 115 and mass storage 112, all coupled to bidirectional system bus 118 along with keyboard 110, mouse 111 and processor 113. the mass storage 112 may include both fixed and removable media, such as magnetic, optical or magnetic optical storage systems or any other available mass storage technology. bus 118 may contain, for example, thirty - two address lines for addressing video memory 114 or main memory 115. the system bus 118 also includes, for example a 32 - bit data bus for transferring data between and among the components, such as processor 113, main memory 115, video memory 114 and mass storage 112. alternatively, multiplex data / address lines may be used instead of separate data and address lines. in one embodiment of the invention, the processor 113 is a microprocessor manufactured by motorola, such as the 680x0 processor or a microprocessor manufactured by intel, such as the 80x86, or pentium processor, or a sparc microprocessor from sun microsystems, inc. however, any other suitable microprocessor or microcomputer may be utilized. main memory 115 is comprised of dynamic random access memory ( dram ). video memory 114 is a dual - ported video random access memory. one port of the video memory 114 is coupled to video amplifier 116. the video amplifier 116 is used to drive the cathode ray tube ( crt ) raster monitor 117, and serves to convert pixel data stored in video memory 114 to a raster signal suitable for use by monitor 117. monitor 117 is a type of monitor suitable for displaying graphic images. computer 100 may also include a communication interface 120 coupled to bus 118. communication interface 120 provides a two - way data communication coupling via a network link 121 to a local network 122. for example, if communication interface 120 is an integrated services digital network ( isdn ) card or a modem, communication interface 120 provides a data communication connection to the corresponding type of telephone line, which comprises part of network link 121. if communication interface 120 is a local area network ( lan ) card, communication interface 120 provides a data communication connection via network link 121 to a compatible lan. wireless links are also possible. in any such implementation, communication interface 120 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals which carry digital data streams representing various types of information. network link 121 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. for example, network link 121 may provide a connection through local network 122 to local server computer 124 or to data equipment operated by an internet service provider ( isp ) 124. isp 124 in turn provides data communication services through the work wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the internet 125. local network 122 and internet 125 both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals which carry digital data streams. the signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 121 and through communication interface 120, which carry the digital data to and from computer 100, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. computer 100 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network ( s ), network link 121, and communication interface 120. in the internet example, remote server computer 126 might transmit a requested code for an application program through internet 125, isp 124, local network 122 and communication interface 120. in accord with the invention, such an application program may be suitable performing methods described herein. the received code may be executed by processor 113 as it is received, and / or stored in mass storage 112, or other non - volatile storage for later execution. in this manner, computer 100 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave. application code may be embodied in any form of computer program product. a computer program product comprises a medium configured to store or transport computer readable code, or in which computer readable code may be embedded. some examples of computer program products are cd -

"the present invention is based on the idea that organizations and knowledge workers would be more efficient in their digital work flow with a holistic architecture that applies metadata to each digital file entered into the system, which can then be controlled in a precise manner through layering of modules to optimize the quality and quantity of digital work produced and consumed, thus providing a method for managing knowledge yield for individuals, groups, and organizations. the following discussion is intended to provide a brief description of an organization & # 39 ; s computing work environment in which the invention may be implemented in the preferred manner. it should be understood, however, that wireless, portable and other computing devices are contemplated for use in connection with the present invention. it is further contemplated that the present invention could be employed in a public version accessible within the internet and world wide web, a private version within an intranet or extranet, or some combination thereof. therefore, the description the embodiments that follow is for the purpose of illustration and not limitation. the knowledge worker in the modern computer work environment experiences high volumes of incoming disparate data from multiple sources and networks, which can then be viewed in one or more computing devices ( not shown ). fig1 depicts the process for dataflow through the invention system, which includes unstructured data 1, heterogeneous metadata 2, member original work 3, and member messaging 4, which could be unstructured or structured, or some combination thereof. each individual member subscribed to the system is provided a software module 5 that is used in conjunction with a computing device in part to input metadata describing the relationships, attributes, and values of each file entered into the system. each file processed for entity disambiguation 6, which can scan the file for pre - existing metadata in languages such as rdf or owl for example, before indexing into the knowledge base 7. by attaching a detailed metadata wrapper to each system file 5, and processing to disambiguate the entity 6 for semantic reduction, the system knowledge base is indexed 7 for high value returns in querying and inference 8 of the databases, which then returns metadata descriptions and network links to be displayed 9 in the module, browser, or other viewer for retrieval, consumption, and application of additional metadata if deemed of value by the member. fig2 illustrates the modular system architecture from the execution of the pre - deployment survey 10, which is the method of obtaining and inputting into the system specific data on the subject organization & # 39 ; s operational, regulatory, and technical restrictions, which provides the initial default settings in the cko module 11. in the preferred method, the cko module is the tool by which organization management sets the system security parameters, administrative permissions, and mandatory messaging for the system, including for the business group modules 12. each business group module 12 is the preferred method for further defining the quality and quantity of data according to the group objective for each individual module 13, which includes components for each member to further tailor their information consumption, manage the data flow relating to their work projects, review their performance metrics, and view their system ratings. fig3 displays a screen capture of the cko module, which allows the administrator to create additional modules 14 with the action options of new, edit, store, or rename 15, select type of module 16, and select administrators from the system administrator database ( not shown ). in addition to managing system - wide mandatory messengers 18, the cko module is used to create and manage system - wide courses by topic, pre - determined maximum volume 19, and minimum quality 20, exemplified as 1 being the lowest value and 10 being the highest. the course delivery time and date 21 is an option that reduces the common bandwidth bottleneck problem in large data networks. the mandatory 22 selection is made available for regulatory and other essential messaging. fig4 is a screen capture of a business group module, which is created with the cko module ( 14 ), exemplified herein in simple generic form, sharing the same functions as the parent module, with the exceptions, however, of optimizing courses for the specific business group objectives 23, such as country cultural relations 24, and has the ability to edit specific individual subscribers for each course 25. fig5 is a screen capture of a generic module provided to each individual member within the system. the individual consumption module can be created with either the cko module ( fig3 ) or the business group module ( fig4 ). similarly to the parent module, the individual module can be used to create courses 26 with the same ability to manage volume 27 and quality 28. additionally, however, under messaging settings the individual can increase or decrease both volume 29 and quality 30 by percentages. with the advanced settings object 31, system members can change delivery settings, compare their metrics ( 35 ) and ratings ( 44 ), compare their metrics to system averages, request expert review of their performance, and review recommendations. the approval options in object 32 provides for transferring existing networks into the member & # 39 ;

s changing work patterns and tool selection. fig6 is a screen capture of the individual performance metrics by activity 35 and by project 41 for a hypothetical system member. the metrics for each activity displayed include hours weekly 36, portion of total work 37, weekly volume 38, average rating 39, and the system quotient 40, which is a proprietary formula and trade secret ( not shown ). the accuracy of the metrics in part is dependent upon the specific software programs used by the subject such as email and word processing, for example, and whether the actual data can be integrated. an automated estimate based on system data may be implemented if actual data is unavailable. in the preferred embodiment, the metrics are visually displayed in color code 42, highlighting areas needing improvement or deserving recognition, thus providing the option to input into an organizational compensation database or worker training courses. fig7 is a screen capture of the ratings for a hypothetical system member, as displayed in the individual module, device viewer, or browser. the member & # 39 ; s original work products 44 are shown as rated 43 by those selected with the individual and parent modules, exemplified here in the preferred embodiment as work groups, peers, master reviewers, and self assessment. in the fig7 example, simple averaging is employed. however, it is expected that subject organizations will employ pre - existing or new ratings formulas, which is reflected in the system adaptability. fig8 is a screen capture of the individual project module for a hypothetical system member. when the individual member proposes a new project 48, the administrator of the parent modules are automatically messaged seeking their approval. upon approval, the role 46 of the individual is displayed which determines whether the member and module is authorized to only view the project files, or edit the project & # 39 ;

"the elements encountered in a gnss tolling system 10 illustrated in fig1 are a gnss satellite 11, an obu 12, a proxy 13 and a back office 14. there is a first exchange of data communication 15 between the obu and the proxy, and a second exchange of data communication 16 between the proxy 13 and a back office 14. there is no limitation with regard to the technology involved with the exchange of information between the different units. there is not necessarily a one - to - one relation between the shown elements ; there will e. g. typically be a number of satellites 11 disseminating information enabling the localization of the obu at any given point in time. all calculations made and / or conclusions drawn with regard to assessment of passages may be performed either locally, like in the individual obus, centrally in a back office or by a proxy or in any other combination found convenient therefore. fig2 illustrates the main components of the obu 12. the obu includes a volatile memory 21, a gnss receiver 22, a processing unit 23, a communication unit 24 and persistent storage 25. the obu may be a physical device dedicated to the gnss tolling system, but it may also be present as a function integrated in other devices fit for the purpose, such as a tachograph or other device, portable, mounted in, or integrated in the vehicle. these components are standard components of an obu unit for gnss road user charging, and their function is therefore not explained in more detail here. it should be emphasized, though, that while the inventive concept makes use of such a system, the gnss 10 and the obu 12 are generally known. the gnss module 10 may be implemented with different levels of sophistication, ranging from a simple gps receiver to a complex navigation unit using information from multiple gnss systems, motion sensors with vehicle instruments and sensors. fig3 shows the general principles of the present method and system in a simplified embodiment. an outer polygon 31 and an inner polygon 32 are shown as well as a schematic representation of a roadway 33 running through the area delimited by the polygons. the arrow to the right of the roadway 33 indicates that this is a one - way street with traffic only from left to right. each polygon is described as an ordered sequence of points defining the vertices ( vi ) of the polygon, thus forming a closed area with non - intersecting vertices. the polygons need not be restricted to a two - dimensional plane. the number of vertices may be different between the outer polygon 31 and the inner polygon 32. in the illustrated embodiment there are six vertices in the outer polygon 31 and eight vertices in the inner polygon 32. the tolling zone 34, typically defined by road operator or traffic authorities, will in its entirety be located in between outer and inner polygons. the area between will be a decision area. the distance r between the inner polygon and the outer polygon is allowed to vary around the perimeter of the polygons, depending on a number of factors assuming to influence the accuracy of the gnss system and other factors, like local geometry and topology, taking into account nominal driving speeds and typical gnss reception quality. these and other relevant factors are well known to persons skilled in the art of gnss systems. in fig3, as an example, the distance r 1 is seen to be less than r 2. for vehicles passing into the zone to be monitored, only passages p in across a border of the inner polygon 32 counts as a valid passing. for passing out, only passages p out across the border of the outer polygon 31 counts as a valid passage. thus the arrangement of two polygons introduces a higher level of confidence and reduces the risk of false zone crossing assessments. the decision of passage of the zone border is thus based on many gnss observations allowing the method to use observations with greater independence mitigating the effects from short term correlation in the measurements derived from satellite signals. fig4 illustrates a situation in which the detected positions for a vehicle follows a slightly uneven pattern, which may typically occur when the driving speed is rather low and when one or more error sources influence ( s ) the position detections. a total of thirteen ( unnumbered ) position detections are indicated, for a vehicle driving from left to right, the first one of these made inside the inner polygon being the seventh. thereafter two position detections are made outside the inner polygon before detections again are made within the inner polygon. the present system is sufficiently versatile to not be fooled by the apparent inconsistency of two measurements made outside the inner polygon after having made a first position detection within the same polygon. thus, it is not an absolute requirement that all position detections are made uninterrupted within the inner polygon for the system to positively conclude that a passage into the area has occurred. instead it could be defined as a requirement that n out of m position detections ( like e. g. 3 out of 5 as indicated by the dotted ellipse in fig4 ) in a series of position detections must be within the polygon in question to positively conclude that a passage has actually occurred. fig5 a illustrates a road network where latitude and longitude description is not alone enough to fully assess if a vehicle if travelling on the bridge 51 or on the road 52 below the bridge. altitude information can be taken into account to resolve the ambiguity. fig5 b illustrates how polyhedrons 51 b, 52 b may be created to enclose the two different road sections. also in the three dimensional case two boundaries are created, in this figure only the outer boundary ( polyhedron ) is shown for each of the roads 51 and 52. the two polyhedrons are used for the same purpose as the two polygons in the two dimensional case, mitigating for positional errors also in the altitude axis. the polygons used to define the zone to be monitored may in some embodiments preferably consist of simple ( two dimensional ) polygons where no edges self - intersect. the polygons may also be three dimensional for reasons given above. the system may for certain embodiments be set up to conclude that a passage into the zone in question has occurred if and only if an uninterrupted succession of n positions have been registered within the first polygon, n being an integer chosen by the system provider. the integer n can typically be 3 or larger. similarly, for certain embodiments, it may be defined as a requirement that an uninterrupted succession of n registered positions outside the second polygon is registered to conclude that a passage out of the zone has occurred. for other embodiments, like e. g. in areas where low speed will typically occur from time to time, the system may rather be set up to conclude that a passage has occurred if at least n out of m position detections in a series of position detections for a given vehicle is inside the polygon in question. in such a case a typical requirement would be that more than e. g. 50 % of the position detections are within the polygon in question to conclude a passage into the zone, i. e. that n / m & gt ; 0. 5. correspondingly, more than e. g. 50 % of the position detections should be outside the polygon in question in order to conclude that a vehicle has left the zone. the threshold should be decided from local factors known to influence the system.","method and system for zone based detection of vehicles passing into and out from a geographical zone using polygons to define the border of said zone , wherein a first polygon defines a virtual border against which vehicles passing into the zone is compared by use of a gnss system comprising an obu in every vehicle to be surveyed by the method . a second polygon larger than the first polygon and completely enveloping said first polygon is defined as a virtual border against which objects passing out from the zone is compared by use of the gnss system ."
"the protective fence illustrated in fig1 comprises a plurality of wires 2 tensioned by springs 4 between a pair of fence poles 6, 8 anchored in the ground, each of the wires 2 being connected to a detector 10 carried by another fence pole 12 intermediate the two fence poles 6, 8. in addition, the protective fence includes further fence poles 14, 16, 18, between fence poles 6, 8 to which the wires are attached, and fence poles 12 carrying the detectors 10. fence poles 14, 16, 18 each carry a wire - guiding device generally designated 20, for maintaining the wires in parallel spaced relationship so that a pull, displacement, severing, or other disturbance of any of the wires 2 will be transmitted to its respective detector 10. it will thus be seen that wires 2 serve as trip - wires which sense an attempted intrusion and actuate the detectors 10. these wires could also serve as the barrier wires of the fence, or the fence could include additional barrier wires ( not shown in fig1 ) such as commonly provided in a barbed - wire fence or chain - link fence. as shown in fig2 - 4, each of the wire - guiding devices 20 is made of sheet metal bent into a u - shape to define a pair of parallel legs 22, 24, connected together by a web 26 at the edge of the sheet. for each of the wires 2 in the protective fence, there is formed a pair of openings 28, 30, through legs 22, 24. these openings are of larger diameter than the respective wire to permit the wire to freely pass through them. the openings 28, 30, are formed a slight distance inwardly of the connecting web 26, and are connected to outer edge of the bent sheet by passageways or slots 32 formed through the web and of smaller width than the diameter of the openings 28, 30. slots 32 permit the wires 2 to be inserted into their respective openings 28, 30 from the edge of the bent sheet defined by the web 26. after the wires have been so inserted, a common locking member, in the form of a rod or bar 34, is inserted from the upper end of the wire - guiding device 20 into the space or channel formed by the two legs 22, 24 of the bent sheet adjacent to its connecting web 26. the common locking rod 34 is then fixed in place by passing a rivet 36 through the two legs 22, 24 of the guiding device, and an eye 38 formed at the upper end of the locking rod 34. if desired, the locking rod 34 may be formed with one or more additional eyes at the lower end, or at intermediate points, for more firmly securing the locking rod to the guiding device. the guiding device 20 furtherincludes a plurality of parallel, spaced short rods 40 received between the pair of legs 22, 24 at longitudinally spaced points of the guiding device for attaching it to its respective fence pole, e. g. 14. each of the attaching rods 40 is also formed with an eye 42 at one end received between the two legs 22, 24 of the guiding device 20, and projects through the edge of the guiding device opposite to its web 26 for attachment to the respective fence pole. preferably, the attaching rods 40 are each pivotably mounted by a pin 44 to the guiding device so as to permit pivoting the rods between the legs 22, 24 to provide a compact unit for shipping and storage purposes. when the guiding device is to be installed in the field, the attaching rods 40 are pivoted outwardly to their illustrated positions, and their free ends are attached to the respective fence pole by welding, rivetting, or other suitable fastening means. the guiding device illustrated in fig1 - 4 may be a part of a new installation of a protective fence, or may be added to an existing protective fence installation. in either case, after the protective fence has been installed with the wires 2 tensioned by springs 4 between the two end fence poles 6, 8, and attached to the detectors 10 carried by the intermediate fence pole 12, the wire - guiding fence poles 14, 16, 18 are anchored in the ground, and a wire - guiding device 20 is attached by the attaching rods 40 to its respective pole 14, 16, 18. the common locking bar 34 is removed from the wire - guiding devices 20, and each wire 2 is inserted through one of the slots 32 into its respective pair of openings 28, 30. the common locking bar 34 is then inserted from one end of the guiding device 20 and is locked in position by applying rivets 36 through one or more of the eyes 38 formed in the common locking bar. after the fence is so installed with the wires maintained in spaced parallel relationship by the wire - guiding devices 20, the wires are connected to their respective detectors 10 carried by fence pole 12. it will thus be seen that a cutting, spreading apart, or pulling - down of any of the wires 2 in an attempt to penetrate the fence will be transmitted as a pulling force to its respective detector 10 which will produce a signal to indicate this attempt. if an attempt is made to disarm any of the wires by securing it to its respective guiding device 20 or common locking bar 34, and thus to prevent the transmission of a force to its respective detector, the force will nevertheless be transmitted because attaching rods 40 will yield or bend, thereby causing the whole guide device 20 to move with the force applied to the respective wire, thereby transmitting this force to the respective detector 10. if an attempt is made to disarm the device by removing the wire from the guiding device 20, this will require cutting through, or removal of, the locking bar 34. this bar can be made of hard metal difficult to cut. its removal can also be made difficult by the type and number of rivets 36 used for fastening the locking bar to the guiding device. it will thus be seen that the guiding device illustrated in fig1 - 4 provides the above - described advantages of simplicity of construction and installation, difficulty of disarming by removing the wires, and compactness for storage and shipping purposes. fig5 and 6 illustrate a second embodiment of the invention which may be used for the fence poles 14, 16, 18 to anchor the guiding device into the ground, and the force - yielding rods 40 for attaching the guiding device in a force - yielding manner. thus, as shown in fig5 and 6, the guiding device, generally designated 120, is in the form of a metal sheet bent into an l - shape. one section 122 of the l - shaped sheet is formed with the openings 124 and the connecting slots 126 for receiving the trip wires 102, the trip wires being retained in these openings against removal by a common locking bar 134 in the same manner as described above with respect to fig1 - 4. the other section 142 of the l - shaped sheet 120 serves as a fence post. its lower end is secured by fasteners 144, 146, to a stake 148 anchored in the ground. it will be appreciated that section 122 of the l - shaped sheet 120 is bent on itself to form the two legs for receiving the wires 102 and the locking bar 134, in the same manner as described above with respect to fig1 - 4. the free end of section 142 may also be bent - over into a u - shape, as shown by leg 150 in fig6 to provide rigidity to section 142. it will be appreciated that the intermediate portion 152 of section 122, extending between the bent - over edge of that section to the juncture with section 142, will yield to a force applied to it in the direction of the fence wires 102. this intermediate portion therefore serves the same function as the force - yielding rods 40 in the fig1 - 4 embodiment. fig7 - 11 illustrate two further forms of trip - wire guiding devices which may be used in the protective fence illustrated in fig1 for device 20. the wire - guiding devices of fig7 - 11 are also attached to ground anchoring means, namely fence pole 214 and 314, respectively, in a force - yielding manner to prevent disarming the device by securing the tensioned trip - wires to the guiding device, and thus prevent the transmission of a force to the respective detector. the wire guiding device 220 illustrated in fig7 - 9 comprises an elongated member in the form of an open spiral rod 222, in which the lateral spaces between adjacent spirals constitute the openings 228 for the tensioned trip - wires 202 and also the edge passageways or slots 232 permitting the insertion of the wires, these elements corresponding to openings 28 and slots 32 in the embodiment of fig1 - 4. in addition, the axial space 233 ( fig9 ) through all the spirals constitutes an elongated channel ( corresponding to the channel between the two legs 22, 24 in the embodiment of fig1 - 4 ) extending longitudinally through the open spiral rod 222 for the reception of the common locking member. the latter is in the form of a straight rod 234 passed longitudinally through the spirals. as shown particularly in fig9 the open spiral rod 222 is flattened, so that its spirals are each of a width substantially less than its length. the inner diameter of the spiral in width is approximately the same, or slightly greater than, the outer diameter of the straight rod 234 serving as the common locking member for the tensioned wires 202. the open - spiral guiding member 222 is attached to the fence pole 214 in a laterally - spaced force - yielding manner by means of another straight rod 238 received longitudinally through the spirals for connection to a plurality of short rods 240 secured to the fence poles 214. each guiding device 220 may be attached by means of a plurality, e. g. four ( only two of which are illustrated in fig7 ) of such short rods 240. as shown in fig7 and 9, each of the short rods 240 is secured at one end to the fence pole 214 by means of a rivet 242, or other securing means, and is formed at its opposite end with an eye 244 oriented so that the axis through the opening in the eye is in the vertical direction. the eyes 244 of all the short rods 240 are disposed in the space between adjacent spirals of the spiral rod 220 such as to receive through their eyes the common securing rod 238 when passed longitudinally through the spirals of the guiding device. the upper ends of the two straight rods 234 and 238 are secured to the open - spiral rod 222 by means of a pair of apertured plates 250, 252 for receiving pins 254, 256 ( e. g., rivets or other fastener devices ) passing through the apertures in the plates, and also through eyes 258, 260 formed in the upper ends of the two straight rods 234, 238. the lower end of the rods 234, 238 is preferably secured in the same manner to the open - spiral rod 222 at its lower end, but this is not illustrated in the drawings for the sake of brevity. the guiding device illustrated in fig7 - 9 of the drawings is installed in the field in the following manner : the main element of the guiding device, namely the open - spiral rod 222, may be supplied in continuous or standard lengths and cut to size in the field according to the height of the fence at the specific location of the guiding device. the open - spiral construction of the guiding device provides, as mentioned above, a wide variety of possibilities for receiving almost any specific number of trip wires 202, and at almost any specific spacing of the trip wires, at the particular installation location. to attach the open spiral rod 222 to the fence pole 214, the short rods 240 are first secured to the fence pole by rivets 242 ( or other suitable securing means ) with the rods 240 extending horizontally and with their eyes 244 open vertically. the open spiral rod 222 is then applied laterally to receive the eyes 244 between its open spirals, and the common locking rod 238 is then inserted through the end ( e. g. upper ) of the open spirals and through the aligned eyes 244 of the short rods 240. the tensioned trip wires 202 are then passed laterally between the open spirals of the spiral rod 222, and the common locking rod 234 is inserted through the open spirals so as to lock the tensioned trip - wires 202 within the spaces. finally, the apertured plates 250, 252 are applied to the upper ends of the straight rods 234, 238, and of the spiral rod 222 ; and rivets 254, 256 ( or other pin - type fasteners ) are passed through the apertures in plate 250, 252 and through the eyes 258, 260 at the upper ends of the straight rods 232, 238. a similar attaching arrangement is made at the lower ends of the spiral rod 222 and the straight rods 234, 238. the assembly thus provides a sturdy guiding device for maintaining the tensioned trip - wires 202 in parallel spaced relationship so that a pull, displacement, severing or other disturbance of any of the wires 202 will be transmitted to its respective detector. the short rods 240 provide a force - yielding attachment of the guiding device 220 to the fence pole 214 so as to prevent disarming any of the wires by securing it to its respective guiding device or either of the two straight rods 234, 238. it will thus be seen that a very inexpensive and an easily attachable guiding device is provided for use with protective fences of different heights, different numbers of fence wires, and different spacing of fense wires. fig1 and 11 illustrate another form of wire - guiding device including but one straight rod, therein designated 338, serving the functions of the two straight rods 234 and 238 in the arrangement of fig7 - 9. thus, the arrangement in fig1 and 11 includes a flattened open spiral rod 322 adapted to receive the tensioned trip - wires 302 in its lateral spaces between adjacent spirals, and the straight rod 338 passed longitudinally through the spirals and serving as the common locking member for locking the tensioned wires within the spirals. the open - spiral rod 322 is attached to the fence pole 314 in a force - yielding manner by means of a plurality of short rods 340 secured at one end to the fence pole by means of rivets 342, and formed at their opposite ends with eyes 344 oriented so as to receive the common locking rod 334. the upper end of the spiral rod 322 is wrapped, as shown at 358, around the straight rod 338 ; the lower end of the spiral rod may be attached in the same manner to the straight rod. while the invention has been described with respect to a protective fence for detecting and protecting against intrusions, it will be appreciated that this application has been described for purposes of example only, and that the invention could be used in fencing construction in general to support the wires in parallel spaced relationship. further, the guiding device may be used as an intermediate floating guide and not attached to any fence pole. also, instead of using a flattened spiral rod, the spirals may be of circular configuration. other variations, modifications and applications of the invention will be appreciated.","a trip - wire guiding device for a protective fence is described including an elongated member attachable to ground - anchoring means intermediate the fence poles and formed with a plurality of openings through which the tensioned trip -

"the present disclosure is directed to an apparatus which will be described first and its operation will be given thereafter. selected equations will be provided setting forth a voltage measurement along with a description of the apparatus and how the complex dielectric constant is obtained from the measuring system shown in fig1. the numeral 10 identifies the dielectric testing system of the present disclosure. it incorporates a network analyze 12 which includes a signal generator 18 forming a signal which is either pulsed or cw. one suitable network analyzer is the hp model 3577a. thus, fig1 shows the signal generator which is actually part of the analyzer to place attention on the transmitted signal. the amplifier 16 is normally inserted as a separate device to boost the power. the amplifier 16 is enabled and thereby forms a fixed amplitude output at an adjustable frequency and which signal has a particular duration or is continuous, and is at a specified power level. the signal is delivered to a transmitter coil 20 which is arranged as a circle in a circular wave guide to be described. the coil 20 thus has one or more turns and forms an electromagnetic field directed along the wave guide. the coil 20 is a microstripline having a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. it is wound in a single turn circle encompassing 360 less the spacing of the two adjacent coaxial connectors at 22, one serving as the cw or pulse input and the other connecting via the line 26 to the analyzer 12. the input signal from the generator 18 ( after amplification ) is supplied through the coaxial terminal 22 and then forms a field ( described below ) in the wave guide 24. the wave guide 24 supports two receiver coils. one is identified at 30 and the other is located at 32. the two coils are receiver coils spaced at equal distances from the transmitter coil 20. again, they are provided with coaxial connectors at 34 and 36. they are preferably duplicate coils formed of microstripline and have a resistor connected to ground for each, namely, the resistors at 38 and 40. the resistors match the characteristic impedance, normally 50 ohms. this termination avoids reflection. the duplicate coils provide output signals to an adder 42 to be described. the adder may be a 180 hybrid coupler or a binary power divider such as anzac model h - 10 - 4. the two signals are added which takes into account a polarity reversal of one relative to the other so that the differences between the two signals are output on the conductor 44. that is input to the analyzer for measurement of the quadrature components. conductors 14, 26, and 44 are typically coaxial transmission lines of 50 ohms characteristic impedance. a core sample 50 is placed in the wave guide 24. the core sample is located in accordance with a coordinate system origin defined at the transmitter coil 20. the coordinate system has an origin marked in fig1 and positive and negative measurements are indicated along the axis of the wave guide 24. the core sample has a length l which is equal to the spacing of the coils 20 and 32 ; that is, l is length along the + z axis. the core 50 fits snugly within the wave guide and its liner 52. the wave guide is constructed as a metal wave guide body on the exterior and a thin insulating lining 52 is on the interior. it is however sufficiently thick to embed the coils 20, 30 and 32 which are placed in it. the preferred liner 52 is a dimensionally stable ceramic or quartz sleeve which accurately ( without change ) fixes the spacing between the three coils 20, 30 and 32. the liner 52 is also accurately sized in diameter to control the diameter of the coils. this positions the coils to form the field as discussed below. ideally, a core sample should suffer the absolute minimum in disturbance from its natural condition prior to making measurements in the laboratory. the present procedure provides a complex dielectric constant measuring system so that electrode contact impedance is avoided by the implementation of this procedure. that is one of the serious drawbacks of previously used systems. one previous approach requires drilling holes in the core sample while another process requires machining ; in both cases, fluid remaining in the core is likely lost while the structure is physically altered. by this method, the core sample is cut from the formation and retrieved without alteration. this absence of subsequent cutting protects the connate fluids. the dielectric properties of the core sample 50 may vary as a function of frequency. the signal generator 18 is swept over a wide range of frequencies and the core sample 50 can thus be tested for many frequencies say, 10 to 1, 000 megahertz or greater. an important factor in this apparatus is the use of a bridge circuit so that the sample 50 is compared with an equal size sample which is air in the preferred instance. the sample size ( derived from coil spacing ) is equal along the measured z - axis ( see fig1 ) as indicated in the drawings from origin at the transmitter coil 20 to the two receiver coils. with exercise of reasonable care, these two distances l are made equal. the distances are thus controlled to within just a few parts per million by embedding the coils as microstriplines in a ceramic or quartz body. the use of equally spaced receiver coils is important to assure balancing of the two output signals so that nearly total cancellation is obtained. air is the preferred standard on the right side of the system, that is, between the coil 20 and the receiver coil 30. alternative materials can be used, provided they are cut into cylinders of specified size, preferably precisely equal to the size of the sample 50 and preferably positioned so that they align with the zero or reference mark on the wave guide 24. sample diameter should be uniform because the signal varies as a fourth power of diameter. this is more significant than sample length. examples of alternate materials are fused silica, alumina, teflon ( a registered trademark of the dupont company ), carbon particles in epoxy resin, and the like. known sample can be used to calibrate to precise dielectric values. a teflon sample will provide a precise lossless, nondispersive dielectric. a carbon filled resin sample will provide a frequency independent measure of conductivity. indeed, it is possible to use other rock samples which have known dielectric measures if desired. there is mutual coupling between the coil 20 and each of the two receiver coils. with no core in either side, the system is zeroes initially by adding of the two receiver output signals at the adder 42. thus, the summed output signal from the adder 42 represents the disturbance in the mutual coupling which arises from the differences between the sample 50 and the reference core ( air or the reference sample ) on the other side of the system. for a given frequency, measurements are made of the adder output voltage, therebeing two measurements, one of the inphase voltage and the other measuring the quadrature voltage. if desired, a chart can be compiled for a multitude of frequencies to provide a direct reading of the complex dielectric constant. fig2 is a chart of data collected at a fixed frequency ( 40 megahertz ) showing the reactive and resistive signals in microvolts. the chart shows measured signal conversion into the a + jb form to provide both components. the complex voltages at the two receiver locations are given by the two equations below. the equations are developed on the premise that a uniform ( or single ) reference such as air is located between the coils 30 and 50. accordingly, the coil 30 is at the distance of l in the - z direction. the coil 32 is located at the opposite maximum distance which is l in the z direction. the core sample has been shown in the drawings to have a length l which spans the distance l from z 0. the test analysis is based on the assumption that the coils are pure magnetic dipoles. suitable electric shields at one or more of the electric coils may be necessary. the core sample may be longer than l without materially impacting the results, establishing that the length is not a critical dimension. the voltages induced in the two receiver coils may be computed from the following expressions. on review of the equations given below, it will be seen intuitively how use of a full length sample between the two coils 32 and 50 simplifies the measurements of lengths of the sample. # # equ1 # # where : v 30 = voltage in coil 30 with air reference of length l v 32 = voltage in coil 32 adjacent to sample of l length 01, 10 = transmission coefficients of core sample at interface to air 01 = reflection coefficient of core sample at interface to air a small, constant adjustment is required for all measurements resulting from the face that the core sample is slightly smaller in diameter than the wave guide inside diameter. in summarizing the present apparatus and method, it should be noted that some occasions will present the need of measuring the complex dielectric constant at an elevated temperature. to this end, an oven 60 is included to raise the temperature of the sample in the wave guide sufficiently to cause duplication of ambient temperatures. the oven 60 therefore provides heating to a level typically up to about 400 f. a closed and sealed oven will provide pressure for the sample for testing at an elevated pressure up to that normally experienced at the formation well depth. while the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment, the scope thereof is determined by the claims which follow.","a system for measuring the complex dielectric constant of a core sample is set forth . it incorporates a circular wave guide having a central axial transmitter coil . equally spaced axial receiver coils are placed on both sides of the transmitter coil . the opposite polarity receiver signals are connected to an adder circuit to provide an output signal representing only the difference in the two received signals . by placing a standard such as air between the transmitter coil and one receiver coil , or core sample positioned between the transmitter coil and the other receiver coil provides a system for obtaining an output indicative of complex dielectric constant . optionally , the system is operated in an oven to provide an elevated temperature , and can also be pressurized with a compressed fluid ."
"fig4 a and fig4 b illustrate a method of fabricating a liquid crystal display device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. referring to fig4 a, an alignment film 27 is formed on an upper substrate 21 sequentially provided with a black matrix 23, color filters 25 and a common electrode 26. the alignment film 27 formed on the upper substrate 21 has a desired alignment state by a rubbing. furthermore, an alignment film 27 is also formed on a lower substrate 1 provided sequentially with a thin film transistor 34 and a pixel electrode 17. likewise, the alignment film 27 formed on the lower substrate 1 has a desired alignment state by a rubbing. a material that can be aligned by a rubbing and a photo - alignment method using an ultraviolet ray ( uv ) is used for the alignment film 27. photo mask 35 are arranged at the upper portions of the upper substrate 21 and at the lower substrate 1 provided with the alignment film 27. the photo masks are arranged in such a manner as to be spaced at a certain distance from the alignment film 27. each of the photo masks 35, provided at the upper substrate 21 and at the lower substrate 1, include a photo mask substrate 35 a and an opaque metal 35 b, wherein the opaque metal 35 b is formed at a desired portion of the photo mask substrate 35 a. the photo mask 35 is aligned with the upper substrate 21 or the lower substrate 1, such that the opaque metal area 35 b corresponds to a pixel area provided within the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1. an ultraviolet ray ( uv ) is irradiated onto the upper substrate 21 and onto the lower substrate 1 arranged with the photo mask 35. the uv ray irradiated onto the upper substrate 21 and onto the lower substrate 1 transmits onto the alignment film 27 a formed within the black matrix area 23, and onto the alignment film 27 b, whereas it fails to transmit onto the alignment film 27 formed within the pixel areas. for this reason, an alignment state of the alignment film 27 a formed within the black matrix area 23 becomes different than the alignment state of the alignment film 27 formed within the pixel area. also, an alignment film 27 b of the lower substrate 1 formed within an area corresponding to the black matrix area 23 has an alignment state different from the alignment state of the alignment film 27 within the pixel area. these alignment films 27 a and 27 b act as a seed of the bend structure upon driving of the liquid crystal cell to stabilize the bend structure. in other words, the alignment film 27 a onto which the uv is irradiated has a larger pre - tilt angle than the alignment film 27 onto which the uv is not irradiated. finally, the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 formed in this manner are correspondingly joined with each other, and then a liquid crystal is injected therebetween. fig5 a and fig5 b illustrate a method of fabricating a liquid crystal display device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. referring to fig5 a, alignment film 37 are formed on an upper substrate 21 provided with a black matrix 23, color filters 25 and a common electrode 26 and a lower substrate 1 provided with a thin film transistor 34 and a pixel electrode 17. a material that can be aligned by a rubbing and a photo - alignment method using an ultraviolet ray ( uv ) is used for the alignment film 37. photo mask 35 are arranged at the upper portions of the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 spaced at a certain distance from the alignment film 37. each of the photo masks 35 provided at the upper portions of the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 includes a photo mask substrate 35 a and an opaque metal 35 b formed at a desired portion of the photo mask substrate 35 a. the photo mask 35 is aligned with the upper substrate 21 or the lower substrate 1 such that the opaque metal area 35 b corresponds to a pixel area provided within the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1. an ultraviolet ray ( uv ) is irradiated onto the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 arranged with the photo mask 35. the uv irradiated onto the upper substrate 21 and onto the lower substrate 1 transmits through the photo mask substrate 35 a onto an alignment film 37 a formed within the black matrix area 23, and onto the alignment film 37 b. whereas the uv irradiated onto the upper substrate 21 and onto the lower substrate 1, fails to transmit through the opaque metal 35 b and onto the alignment film 37 formed within the pixel areas. thereafter, the alignment film 37 formed on the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 undergo a rubbing treatment. for this reason, an alignment state of the alignment film 37 a formed within the black matrix area 23 becomes different from that of the alignment film 37 within the pixel area onto which the uv has not been irradiated. also, an alignment film 37 b of the lower substrate 1 formed within an area corresponding to the black matrix area 23 has an alignment state different from the alignment film 37 within the pixel area. in other words, the alignment film 37 a and 37 b onto which the uv is irradiated have a larger pre - tilt angle than the alignment film 37 onto which the uv is not irradiated. finally, the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 formed in this manner are correspondingly joined with each other, and then a liquid crystal is injected therebetween. fig6 a and fig6 b illustrate a state of the lcd panel when changing a characteristic of the alignment film formed within the black matrix area by the alignment method using a rubbing and a photo - alignment method. fig6 a and 6b also show joining the upper substrate with the lower substrate, and thereafter injecting a liquid crystal therebetween according with the above - mentioned embodiments. as shown in fig6 a, an alignment state at the pixel area of a liquid crystal 32 injected into a space between the upper substrate 21 and the lower substrate 1 is different from an alignment state at the black matrix area 23 thereof. this is because the alignment film 27 within the pixel area has an alignment state different from the alignment film 27 a within the black matrix area 23. in other words, the alignment film 27 a within the black matrix area 23 is aligned to have a larger pre - tilt angle than the alignment film 27 within the pixel area by a rubbing and an ultraviolet ray. accordingly, upon injection of the liquid crystal 32, the liquid crystal 32 injected within the black matrix area 23 has a larger pre - tilt angle ( i. e., above 50 degrees at the surface thereof ) than the liquid crystal 32 having been injected within the pixel area. meanwhile, as shown in fig6 b, the liquid crystal 32 within the black matrix area 23 re - arranged into a splay structure having a large pre - tilt angle has a more stable state than the liquid crystal 32 within the pixel area having a relatively small pre - tilt angle. for this reason, the liquid crystal 32 within the pixel area adjacent to the liquid crystal 32 arranged at a large pre - tilt angle within the black matrix area 23 is re - arranged to have a large pre - tilt angle. in other words, since the liquid crystal 32 existing within the pixel area has more unstable state than the liquid crystal 32 existing within the black matrix area 23, it shows a changing property into the liquid crystal existing within the black matrix area 23. accordingly, the liquid crystal 32 within the pixel area which is adjacent to the liquid crystal 32 existing within the black matrix area 23 begins to change into a stable state and the remaining liquid crystal 32 is gradually changed into a stable state. ultimately, all the liquid crystal 32 within the pixel area becomes stable by such a gradual state change. fig7 shows a unit pixel of the liquid crystal display device depicted by simulation data values measured when the liquid crystal within the black matrix area has been aligned at a pre - tilt angle larger than liquid crystal within the pixel area by about 40 degrees. each portion indicated by the dotted lines in fig7 represents a direction of the liquid crystal. total energy values when increasing a pre - tilt angle of the liquid crystal within the black matrix in a state of fixing a pre - tilt angle of the liquid crystal within the pixel area as shown in fig1 are given the following table : as seen from table 1, if a pre - tilt angle within the black matrix area is large, the liquid crystal within the black matrix area is easily arranged in a bend state and, simultaneously, the liquid crystal at the pixel area adjacent to the black matrix area is liable to re - arrangement in a stable bend state. in other words, as the liquid crystal within the black matrix area has a larger pre - tilt angle, a total energy of the liquid crystal display device is reduced. accordingly, the liquid crystal within the pixel area keeps a more stable state. as a result, the alignment film within the black matrix area is irradiated by an ultraviolet ray and undergoes a rubbing treatment, thereby allowing a pre - tilt angle within the black matrix area to be larger than a pre - tilt angle within the pixel area. accordingly, upon initialization of the liquid crystal display device, the liquid crystal arranged at a large pre - tilt angle within the black matrix area permits the liquid crystal arranged within the pixel area to be easily arranged in a stable bend structure. also, the liquid crystal within the pixel area adjacent to the black matrix area having a low transfer of an electric field upon driving is not changed into a splay structure, but is kept at the bend structure, so that a stable bend structure can be obtained. as described above, according to the present invention, the liquid crystal within the black matrix area is arranged at a large pre - tilt angle upon initialization of the liquid crystal display device, so that a bend structure can be obtained in a fast and stable manner. although the present invention has been explained by the embodiments shown in the drawings described above, it should be understood to the ordinary skilled person in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments, but rather that various changes or modifications thereof are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention. accordingly, the scope of the invention shall be determined only by the appended claims and their equivalents.","a method of fabricating a liquid crystal display capable of arranging a liquid crystal injected within a liquid crystal display panel into a stable bend structure within a short time . the liquid crystal display includes a non -

on - a - chip ( soc ) or a megacell 44. while using a system - on - a - chip may be preferred, obtaining the benefits of the systems and methods as described herein does not require the use of a system - on - a - chip. fig2 shows a portion of the megacell 44 in greater detail. the processor 46 comprises a core 12, a memory management unit ( mmu ) 22 and a register bank 80 including a current program status register ( cpsr ) 82 and a secure configuration register ( scr ) 84, described further below. the processor 46 couples to a security state machine ( ssm ) 56 by way of a security monitoring ( secmon ) bus 73, also described below. the processor 46 couples to the ram 24 and rom 48 by way of an instruction bus 50, a data read bus 52 and a data write bus 54. the instruction bus 50 may be used by the processor 46 to fetch instructions for execution from one or both of the ram 24 and rom 48. data read bus 52 may be the bus across which data reads from ram 24 propagate. likewise, data writes from the processor 46 may propagate along data write bus 54 to the ram 24. the rom 48 and the ram 24 are partitioned into public and secure domains. specifically, the rom 48 comprises a public rom 68, accessible in non - secure mode, and a secure rom 62, accessible in secure mode. likewise, the ram 24 comprises a public ram 64, accessible in non - secure mode, and a secure ram 60, accessible in secure mode. in at least some embodiments, the public and secure domain partitions in the rom 48 and the ram 24 are virtual ( i. e., non - physical ) partitions generated and enforced by the mmu 22. the ssm 56 monitors the mmu 22 for security purposes via bus 25, as described further below. secure rom 62 and secure ram 60 preferably are accessible only in secure mode. in accordance with embodiments of the invention, the ssm 56 monitors the entry into, execution during and exiting from the secure mode. the ssm 56 preferably is a hardware - based state machine that monitors various signals within the computing system 100 ( e. g., instructions on the instruction bus 50, data writes on the data write bus 52 and data reads on the data read bus 54 ) and activity in the processor core 12 through secmon bus 73. each of the secure and non - secure modes may be partitioned into user and privileged modes. programs that interact directly with an end - user, such as a web browser, are executed in the user mode. programs that do not interact directly with an end - user, such as the operating system ( os ), are executed in the privileged mode. by partitioning the secure and non - secure modes in this fashion, a total of four modes are made available. as shown in fig3, in order of ascending security level, these four modes include the non - secure user mode 300, the non - secure privileged mode 302, the secure user mode 306, and the secure privileged mode 304. there is an intermediate monitor mode 308, described further below, between the modes 302 and 304. the computer system 100 may operate in any one of these five modes at a time. the computer system 100 may switch from one mode to another. fig3 illustrates a preferred mode - switching sequence 298. the sequence 298 is preferred because it is more secure than other possible switching sequences. for example, to switch from the non - secure user mode 300 to the secure privileged mode 304, the system 100 should first pass through non - secure privileged mode 302 and the monitor mode 308. likewise, to pass from the secure user mode 306 to the non - secure user mode 300, the system 100 should switch from the secure user mode 306 to the secure privileged mode 304, from the secure privileged mode 304 to the monitor mode 308, from the monitor mode 308 to the non - secure privileged mode 302, and from the non - secure privileged mode 302 to the non - secure user mode 300. each mode switch is enacted by the adjustment of bits in the cpsr 82 and the scr 84. the cpsr 82 comprises a plurality of mode bits. the status of the mode bits determines which mode the computer system 100 is in. each mode corresponds to a particular combination of mode bits. the mode bits may be manipulated to switch modes. for example, the bits may be manipulated to switch from mode 300 to mode 302. the scr 84 comprises a non - secure ( ns ) bit. the status of the ns bit determines whether the computer system 100 is in secure mode or non - secure mode. in at least some embodiments, an asserted ns bit indicates that the system 100 is in non - secure mode. in other embodiments, an asserted ns bit indicates that the system 100 is in secure mode. adjusting the ns bit switches the system 100 between secure and non - secure modes. because the status of the ns bit is relevant to the security of the system 100, the ns bit preferably is adjusted only in the monitor mode 308, since the monitor mode 308 is, in at least some embodiments, the most secure mode. more specifically, when the system 100 is in the monitor mode 308, the processor 46 executes monitor mode software ( not specifically shown ) on the secure rom 62, which provides a secure transition from the non - secure mode to the secure - mode, and from the secure mode to the non - secure mode. in particular, the monitor mode software performs various security tasks to prepare the system 100 for a switch between the secure and non - secure modes. the monitor mode software may be programmed to perform security tasks as desired. if the processor 46 determines that these security tasks have been properly performed, the monitor mode software adjusts the ns bit in the scr register 84, thereby switching the system 100 from non - secure mode to secure mode, or from secure mode to non - secure mode. the ns bit and the cpsr bits are provided by the processor 46 to the ssm 56 via the secmon bus 73. the ssm 56 uses the secmon bus 73 to monitor any mode switches enacted by the processor 46. for example, if the system 100 switches from the non - secure user mode 300 to the non - secure privileged mode 302, the cpsr mode bits on the secmon bus 73 reflect the mode switch. the ssm 56 receives the updated cpsr mode bits and determines that the system 100 has switched from the non - secure user mode 300 to the non - secure privileged mode 302. likewise, if the system 100 switches from the non - secure privileged mode 302 to the secure privileged mode 304, the processor 46 updates the cpsr mode bits to reflect the mode switch, and further unasserts the ns bit in the scr 84 to reflect the switch from the non - secure mode to the secure mode. upon receiving the updated cpsr mode bits and the ns bit, the ssm 56 determines that the system 100 has switched from the non - secure mode to the secure mode and, more specifically, from the non - secure privileged mode 302 to the secure privileged mode 304. the ssm 56 uses the secmon bus 73 in this way to ensure that the processor 46 does not take any action that may pose a security risk. for example, for security reasons, the processor 46 preferably adjusts the ns bit in the scr 84 only when the system 100 is in the monitor mode 308. the ssm 56 uses the secmon bus 73 to ensure that the processor 46 does not adjust the ns bit when the system 100 is not in monitor mode 308. thus, if the ssm 56 detects that the ns bit is being adjusted by the processor 46 and the cpsr 82 mode bits indicate that the system 100 is in the monitor mode 308, the ssm 56 takes no action. however, if the ssm 56 detects that the ns bit is being adjusted and the cpsr mode bits indicate that the system 100 is not in monitor mode 308 ( e. g., the system 100 is in one of the modes 300, 302, 304 or 306 ), the ssm 56 may report a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 via the security violation bus 64. the power reset control manager 66 then may reset the system 100. the ssm 56 also may take any of a variety of alternative actions to protect the computer system 100. examples of such protective actions are provided in the commonly owned patent application entitled, system and method of identifying and preventing security violations within a computing system, u. s. patent application ser. no. 10 / 961, 748, incorporated herein by reference. in addition to monitoring the ns bit and / or cpsr bits, the ssm 56 also may use the secmon bus 73 to ensure that when switching modes, the processor 46 does not deviate from the preferred mode switching path shown in fig3. in particular, the ssm 56 monitors the cpsr bits provided on the secmon bus 73. each mode ( e. g., mode 300, 302, 304, 306, and 308 ) corresponds to a particular combination of cpsr bits. by decoding the cpsr bits provided on the secmon bus 73, the ssm 56 determines the mode in which the computer system 100 is operating. if, in decoding the cpsr bits, the ssm 56 determines that the processor 46 has performed an illegal mode switch ( e. g., from mode 300 to mode 304 without first passing through modes 302 and 308 ), the ssm 56 reports a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 via the security violation bus 64. the ssm 56 alternatively may take any other suitable action ( s ) to protect the computer system 100, such as those disclosed in the u. s. patent application ser. 10 / 961, 748 referenced above. in addition to monitoring the ns bit, the ssm 56 also may use the secmon bus 73 in conjunction with the mmu bus 25 to monitor the mmu 22 and to ensure that the mmu & # 39 ; s activities do not compromise the security of the computer system 100. for example, for security reasons, it is undesirable for the mmu 22 to be disabled when switching from non - secure mode to secure - mode. accordingly, the ssm 56 checks bus 25 to ensure that the mmu 22 is enabled when the ns bit on the secmon bus 73 indicates that the system 100 is switching from the non - secure mode to the secure mode. for example, if the mmu 22 is disabled when the ns bit is unasserted, the ssm 56 reports a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 via the security violation bus 64. alternatively, the ssm 56 may take any of the protective actions mentioned above. for security reasons, it is also undesirable to fetch instructions from public ( i. e., unsecure ) memory when in the secure or monitor modes. for this reason, the ssm 56 may monitor both the instruction bus 50 and the secmon bus 73 to ensure that while the system 100 is in either the monitor mode or secure mode, the processor 46 does not fetch an instruction from the public rom 68 and / or the public ram 64. if the ssm 56 detects that an instruction tagged as unsecure is fetched on the instruction bus 50 while bits on the secmon bus 73 indicate that the system 100 is in monitor or secure mode, the ssm 56 reports a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 via the security violation bus 64. the ssm 56 also may take alternative measures to protect the computer system 100 as mentioned above. for security reasons, it is also undesirable to read data from and / or write data to public ( i. e., unsecure ) memory when in the monitor mode. for this reason, the ssm 56 may monitor the data read bus 52, the data write bus 54 and the secmon bus 73 to ensure that the processor 46 does not read data from and / or write data to either the public rom 68 and / or the public ram 64 while the system 100 is in the monitor mode. for example, if the ssm 56 detects that data read from the public rom 68 is being carried on the data read bus 52 while bits on the secmon bus 73 indicate that the system 100 is in the monitor mode, the ssm 56 reports a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 or takes some other suitable, protective measure. in another example, if the ssm 56 detects that data is being written to the public ram 64 via data write bus 54 and the secmon bus 73 indicates that the system 100 is in monitor mode, the ssm 56 takes a suitable, protective measure ( e. g., reports a security violation to the power reset control manager 66 ). fig4 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 400 used to monitor the computer system 100 for at least some of the security violations mentioned above. the process 400 begins by monitoring the processor 46 using the ssm 56 ( block 402 ). the process 400 further comprises determining whether one or more of the cpsr mode bits have been altered ( block 404 ). as mentioned above, the ssm 56 determines whether one or more of the cpsr mode bits have been altered by monitoring the secmon bus 73. if any of the cpsr mode bits have been altered, the process 400 comprises determining whether an illegal mode switch has occurred ( block 406 ). an illegal mode switch may be, for example, a deviation from the preferred mode switching pattern shown in fig3. the pattern may be stored, for instance, on the cpu 46 or on one of the memories 24 or 48. if an illegal mode switch has occurred, the process 400 comprises reporting a security violation and taking one or more suitable, protective measures ( block 408 ). otherwise, the process 400 then comprises using the secmon bus 73 to determine whether the ns bit is being changed ( block 410 ). if the ns bit is being changed, the process 400 comprises using the cpsr bits on the secmon bus 73 to determine whether the change is occurring ( or occurred ) with the computer system 100 in the monitor mode ( block 412 ). if the change in the ns bit is occurring ( or occurred ) with the computer system 100 in a mode other than the monitor mode, the process 400 comprises reporting a security violation and taking one or more suitable, protective measures ( block 408 ). the above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. it is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.",a system comprising a processor adapted to activate multiple security levels for the system and a monitoring device coupled to the processor and employing security rules pertaining to the multiple security levels . the monitoring device restricts usage of the system if the processor activates the security levels in a sequence contrary to the security rules .
"in accordance with the present invention, a computer system ap 1 comprises a data processor 10, main memory 12, and a cache 20, as shown in fig1. data processor 10 issues requests along a processor address bus adp, which includes address lines, a read - write control line, a memory - request line, and a sequential - address signal line. data transfers between cache 20 and processor 10 take place along processor data bus dtp. similarly, cache 20 can issue requests to memory 12 via memory address bus adm. data transfers between cache 20 and memory 12 are along memory data bus dtm. cache 20 comprises a processor interface 21, a memory interface 23, a cache controller 25, a read - output multiplexer 27, and cache memory 30. cache controller 25 includes a line - address memory 28 and a tag - match flag 29. cache memory 30 includes four sets s 1, s 2, s 3, and s 4. set s 1 includes 64 memory locations, each with an associated six - bit index. each memory location stores a line of data and an associated 22 - bit tag. each line of data holds four 32 - bit words of data. cache sets s 2, s 3, and s 4 are similar and use the same six - bit indices. line - address memory 28 includes registers for storing a previous line address and the present line address. in addition, line - address memory 28 provides a validity bit for the previous line address. if this bit indicates invalidity, any comparison results in an inequality. a method m 1 implemented by cache 20 is flow charted in fig2. step s 1 a involves determining whether or not a cache - related read operation is being asserted. if, for example, a write operation is asserted initially, method m 1 terminates at step s 1 b. an alternative write method is invoked instead. in an exemplary first iteration of method m 1, a word - wide read operation asserts an address with an index portion of 000010 and a word address portion of 11 ( the last word of a line ). when a read is asserted, step s 2 a involves determining whether or not the read is a sequential read. a read is sequential if the asserted address is the successor to the address asserted in an immediately prior read operation. in the case of processor 10, the sequential read is indicated by a corresponding signal level on the sequential read signal line of processor address bus adp. in this first iteration of method m 1, the read is nonsequential ; in which case, method m 1 proceeds to step s 3 a. step s 3 a involves comparing the present line address ( the asserted address, ignoring the least - significant bits that indicate word position within a cache line and byte position within a word ) with the line address of an immediately preceding read operation. upon initialization, the validity bit associated with the old line address is set to invalid. so during this first iteration, the comparison indicated at step s 4 a is negative. if at any time during a sequence of reads, the data at the line location indicated by the line - address memory is invalid, the validity bit is set to invalid and any comparison with a new line address has a negative result. in the example, the first iteration of comparison step s 4 a has a negative result. accordingly, the memory locations of all four sets s 1, s 2, s 3, and s 4 with the appropriate indexes are accessed in parallel read step s 5 a. concurrently, the tags stored at these locations are compared with the tag portion ( bits 1 - 22 ) of the asserted address. if there is a match, multiplexer 27 is controlled so that data from the set with the matching tag is provided to processor 10 via processor interface 21 and processor data bus dtp. if there is a miss, cache 20 fetches the line with the requested data from memory 12 via memory interface 23. cache 20 asserts the line address via memory address bus adm and receives the requested data along memory data bus dtm. cache 20 then writes the fetched line to the appropriately indexed location in a selected set in accordance with a replacement algorithm designed to optimize future hits. the read request is then satisfied from the cache location to which the fetched line was written. for this example, assume that the line is stored at set s 1, index 000010. the four least - significant bits of the asserted read address determine the location within the line from which the requested data is provided to processor 10. whether there was a hit or miss, the requested line address is stored at step s 6 a. in addition, the tag portion of this line address is compared to the tag stored in the same set at the next index location. in this example, the next index location is at set s 1, index 000011. if the tags match, the tag - match flag 29 is set to true ; if the tags do not match, the flag is set to false. method m 1 then returns to step s 1 a for a second iteration. in this example, the index portion is 000010 as in the first iteration, and the word position is 10 ( third word position of four ). thus, the second read operation is non - sequential but the line address is the same. thus, at step s 2 a, the result is negative, but the result of the comparison at s 3 a is positive. thus, at step s 4 a, method m 1 proceeds to same - set read step s 5 b. in step s 5 b, only one set is accessed. that set is the same set that provided the data to processor 10 in the immediately prior read operation. in this example, set s 1 is accessed to the exclusion of sets s 2, s 3, and s 4. this results in a power savings relative to a parallel read. method m 1 proceeds to step s 6 a overwritting the previous line address with the current line address. ( the net result is no change since the new and old line addresses are the same ). at step s 6 b, the tag at set s 1, index 000011, is compared to the tag portion of the requested address. flag 29 is set accordingly. again, there is no change because the same comparison is performed in the previous iteration. method m 1 proceeds to step s 1 a for a third iteration. in this example, the third iteration involves a sequential read of the last word at the same line address as the second read. accordingly, method m 1 proceeds through steps s 1 a and s 2 a to arrive at step s 2 b. step s 2 b involves determining whether the current address points to the start of a line. if a sequential read points to the start of a line, then the previous address pointed to the end of the previous line. therefore, the sequential read has crossed a line boundary. in this illustrative third iteration, a line boundary is not crossed. accordingly, method m 1 proceeds to step s 5 b, so that only set s 1 is accessed. method m 1 proceeds through steps s 6 a and s 6 b with no net change in line address or flag. a fourth iteration is begun with a return to step s 1 a. in this fourth iteration, we assume a sequential read. since the third read at the third iteration was of the fourth word in a four - word line, the fourth read is to the beginning of the next line ( index 000011 ). accordingly, in this fourth iteration, method m 1 proceeds through steps s 1 a and s 2 a to step s 2 b. in step s 2 b, the word address bits 00 indicate that the requested data is at the start of a line. when the result of s 2 b is positive, method m 1 proceeds to step s 3 b. step s 3 b involves checking tag - match flag 29. this was set in the last iteration of step s 6 b. if the tag at set s 1 index 000011 was the same as the tag at set s 1, index 000010, it was set to true. this means that the sequential read of this fourth iteration can validly cross the line boundary between indices 000010 and 000011 in set s 1. thus, method m 1 proceeds to same - set read step s 5 b. on the other hand, if the tags differ, the line boundary cannot be validly crossed. accordingly, a parallel read is conducted at step s 5 c. ( step s 5 c is the same as step s 5 a. ) both steps s 5 b and s 5 c are followed by step s 6 a. a new line address ( corresponding to the new index 000011 ) is written at step s 6 a. also, the tag - match flag is re - determined at step s 6 b. in this case, the flag indicates whether the tag at set s 1 at index 000100 matches the tag at 000011. in a fifth iteration of method m 1, a write operation is assumed. in this case, there is a two - cycle write. as flow charted in fig2 method m 1 terminates at step s 1 b. however, the invention provides for updating the line addresses, as in step s 6 a, and tag - match flag, as in step s 6 b, during write operations. when this is done, it is possible for a same - set read to occur immediately after a write operation. an alternative computer system ap 2 comprises a data processor 60, main memory 62, and a cache 70, as shown in fig3. data processor 60 issues requests along a processor address bus a 2 p, which includes address lines, a read - write control line, a memory - request line, and a sequential - address signal line. data transfers between cache 70 and processor 60 take place along processor data bus d 2 p. similarly, cache 70 can issue requests to main memory 62 via memory address bus a 2 m. data transfers between cache 70 and memory 62 are along memory data bus d 2 m. cache 70 comprises a processor interface 71, a memory interface 73, a cache controller 75, a read - output multiplexer 77, and cache memory 80. cache memory 80 includes four sets se 1, se 2, se 3, and se 4. set se 1 includes 64 memory locations, each with an associated six - bit index. each memory location stores a line of data and an associated 22 - bit tag. each line of data holds four 32 - bit words of data. cache sets se 2, se 3, and se 4 are similar and use the same six - bit indices. computer system ap 2 differs from computer system ap 1 primarily in the arrangement of the respective controllers. controller 75 comprises tag - matching function 79, a current - address register 81, a sequential - detect function 83, a beginning - of - line detect function 85, an end - of - line detect function 87, and last - address - type flags 89. tag - matching function 79 has four flags f 1, f 2, f 3, and f 4, which correspond respectively to sets se 1, se 2, se 3, and se 4. each flag indicates whether or not there is a tag match of interest for the respective set. last - address - type flags 89 include a flag f 5 that indicates whether or not the last address was sequential and a flag f 6 that indicates whether or not the last address pointed to the end of a cache line. current - address register 81 stores not only the current address, but also control data reflecting the transfer type ( sequential or non - sequential ) and the transfer width ( byte, doublet, or quadlet ). register 81 provides the transfer type bit to sequential detect function 83, the word position bits to beginning - of - line detect function 85, and word position and transfer width data to end - of - line detect function 87. each of the detect functions 83, 85, and 87, provide their respective detection data to tag - matching function 79. in addition, tag - matching function 79 can read last - address - type flags f 5 ( sequential? ) and f 6 ( end - of - line ). finally, tag - matching function 79 can access cache storage 80 to identify tag matches. an iterated method m 2 practiced in the context of cache controller 75 is indicated in the flow chart of fig5. a read request is received at step t 1. a determination is made whether the read is sequential or non - sequential at step t 2. if the read is sequential, the word position within the selected cache line is checked at step t 3. if the word position of a sequential transfer is at the beginning of a cache line, last - address type flags f 5 and f 6 are checked at step t 4 a. if from step t 5, the previous read request was both sequential and end - of - line, tag match flags f 1 - f 4 are checked at step t 6 a. if there is no match between the tag of the previous address at the cache location with an index one greater than that indicated by the previous address, a parallel read is performed at step t 7 a. if a flag f 1 - f 4 indicates such a match, a one - set read is performed, at step t 7 b, at the incremented index in the set corresponding to the affirmative flag. in an alternative embodiment, there is only one flag that indicates whether there is a match within the same set as in the previous read request. if the word position is at the end of a cache line, as determined at step t 3, end - of - line flag f 6 is set. if the end - of - line read is sequential, sequential - type flag f 5 is set. in the next iteration of method m 2, these flags can be used at step t 4 a. if the word position of step t 3 is neither beginning of line or end of line, a same - set read is performed at step t 7 c. if at step t 2, the read is non - sequential, match flags f 1 - f 4 and sequential flag f 5 are reset to negative at step t 6 b. in this case, method m 2 proceeds to a parallel read at step t 7 a. in system ap 2, tags at a successor index location are only checked when the present read is to the end of a line. this reduces the frequency of such tag checks. on the other hand, the asserted word location must be checked to determine whether or not a tag comparison should be made. where, as in the present case, the processor provides for different transfer widths, e. g., byte, doublet, and quadlet ( word, in this case ), the bits to be checked to recognize an end - of - line data request are a function of this width. thus, this embodiment requires additional complexity to avoid superfluous tag matches. in another alternative embodiment of the invention, instead of single flag 29, there is a flag associated with each index. during each read operation, all tags in the set from which a read is provided are compared to the tag portion of the read request. the flags are set according to the results. in a subsequent read with an arbitrary index portion, the associated flag can be checked. if the flag indicates true, a single - set read can be implemented. otherwise, a parallel read operation is implemented. this approach reduces the number of parallel reads, but incurs a cost in cache complexity. these and other variations upon and modifications to the described embodiments are provided for by the present invention, the scope of which is defined by the following claims.","a set - associative cache - management method utilizes both parallel reads and single - cycle single - set reads . the parallel reads involve accessing data from all cache sets in parallel before a tag match is determined . once a tag match is determined , it is used to select the one of the accessed cache memory locations to be coupled to the processor for the read operation . single - cycle single - set reads occur when the line address of one read operation matches the line address of an immediately preceding read operation satisfied from the cache . in such a case , only the set from which the previous read request was satisfied is accessed in the present read operation . the single - set reads save power relative to the parallel reads , while maintaining the speed advantages of the parallel reads over serial  tag - then - data  reads ."

"a beam of neutral atoms or molecules each having a magnetic dipole moment m d is propagatable along the z axis of a cartesian coordinate system. if a homogeneous magnetic field h is applied in the y direction, the torque expressed by the equation : influences each beam particle. it is known from atomic physics that the magnetic dipole moment is a function of the angular momentum of the electron shell j according to the equation : and that the torque d effects precession of j and m d around the y - axis. the precessional frequency is defined by the equation : in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), b = magneton ; h = h / 2 ( h = planck & # 39 ; s constant ), m e = electron rest mass, and g j = landes & # 39 ; g - factor. given such precession, only the y - component of the dipole moment m d remains constant with time. this y - component of the dipole moment m d is related to the magnetic quantum number m j by the equation : wherein the magnetic quantum number m j may assume a total of 2j + 1 values where j is the total angular momentum quantum number of the electron shell. in order that the y - component of the dipole moment, m dy, is of the same size for all beam particles, all beam particles must exhibit the same magnetic quantum number m j. other quantum states can be stripped, for example, with a stern - gerlach separator. when the particles are aligned as described above, only the chronologically constant component m dy of the dipole moment need be considered for the beam deflection and beam focusing, because the transit time is large in comparison to the precessional period t p, according to the relationships : which can be achieved by means of a sufficiently high b - field. in equation ( 5 ), l is the beam length and v is the velocity of the beam particles. the force f exerted on magnetic dipole particles in a magnetic field h is expressed by the equation : # # equ1 # # requiring the magnetic field h to have a gradient for deflecting the dipole particle in the direction of the magnetic dipole moment m d. in the simplest case, such a gradient may be selected to be a constant. quadrupole fields having the following configuration exhibit such a constant field gradient : # # equ2 # # in the above equations constituting ( 7 ), is the scalar magnetic potential and 2c ( z ) and 2s ( z ) are field coefficients which are not dependent on x or y. using the expression m d = m dy e y, and substituting the magnetic field h from equation ( 7 ) into equation ( 6 ) for the force f, the following expression for the force f derives : # # equ3 # # the quadrupole field b according to equation ( 7 ) causes deflection of neutral particles exhibiting a magnetic moment m d = m dy e y both in the y - direction and in the x - direction. by superimposing the quadrupole field which causes deflection in the x - direction and the quadrupole field which effects deflection in the y - direction, deflection of the neutral particles, which essentially exhibit only a y - component of the magnetic dipole moment, can be accomplished in any desired direction. the deflection direction having a deflection angle a is determined by the ratio of the field coefficients 2c / 2s from equation ( 7 ) as follows : # # equ4 # # the magnitude of the deflection coordinate r a = x a 2 + y a 2 is proportional to 2c 2 + 2s 2. the generation of an azimuthally rotatable quadrupole field which is variable in intensity utilizing a magnetic six - pole or eight - pole lens is described in greater detail below in connection with fig1 and fig2. although neutral particles exhibiting a magnetic dipole moment can be focused by means of six - pole magnets, such focusing is generally convergent in only one section and is divergent, i. e., & # 34 ; defocusing & # 34 ; in another section. because the magnetic dipole moments of the beam particles in the sample embodiment discussed herein are aligned in the y - direction by the external magnetic field h, the six - pole field for focusing the beam particles should be of the form : is allocated. the following motion equation can then be derived utilizing equation ( 10 ) : # # equ5 # # in equation ( 12 ), m denotes the mass of a neutral particle, and t designates time. applying the chain rule for derivatives, t can be eliminated from equation ( 12 ) as follows : # # equ6 # # wherein v denotes the particle velocity. the following two orbital equations can then be derived : # # equ7 # # analysis of the equations designated ( 13 ) shows that when the coefficient 3s is greater than zero, focusing occurs along the x - section and diverging or defocusing occurs in the y - section ; however, when the coefficient 3s is less than zero, defocusing occurs in the x - section and focusing occurs in the y - section. additionally, the paraxial orbital equations for a neutral particle exhibiting a magnetic dipole moment designated at ( 13 ) exhibit the same shape in a six - pole field as the paraxial orbital equations of a charged particle in a quadrupole field. the paraxial orbital equations of a charged particle in a quadrupole field are described in the text & # 34 ; quadrupoles in electron lens design, & # 34 ; p. w. hawkes, academic press ( 1970 ). this means that all laws known from quadrupole optics can be fully transferred for focusing neutral particles in the embodiment disclosed herein. stigmatic imaging with neutral particles can be achieved with a pair of six - pole magnets, of which one six - pole magnet has a coefficient 3s greater than zero, and the other of which has a coefficient 3s less than zero. in such an embodiment, however, the two primary enlargements v x and v y are no longer variable without changing the subject - to - lens distance, the image distance, or the distance between the pair of six - pole lenses. if a trio of six - pole lenses is employed, stigmatic imaging can be achieved and the quotient v y / v x of the two primary enlargements can be varied within certain limits by changing the six - pole lens strengths without deteriorating the stigmatic image plane. utilizing four six - pole lenses, it is possible to separately change the primary enlargements v y and v x within certain limits without losing stigmatic imaging in the fixed image plane. the magnetic induction b necessary for alignment of the neutral particle beam has the relation : # # equ8 # # wherein u b is the kinetic energy of the neutral particle expressed in volts and m is the mass of the neutral particle. utilizing arsenic as an example in equation ( 14 ), which has an atomic weight of 74. 9 and a lande factor g j = 2 ( because of ground energy level 4 s 3 / 2 ), and assuming a beam length l = 0. 2 m and a voltage ub = 2 kv, the magnetic induction b must be significantly greater than 0. 3 gauss, which is relatively easy to achieve. the equation for computing the maximum possible beam deflection, neglecting the fringe field, is : # # equ9 # # for the deflection y a according to the fundamental calculation. in equation ( 15 ), l indicates the path length along which the magnetic induction b influences the neutral particles and l indicates the distance which the neutral particles traverse after influence of the magnetic induction up to the location at which the deflection y a is measured. the following exemplary calculation can be undertaken to determine the maximum deflection y a. assume 2c is the quadrupole coefficient of a magnetic field b expressed as follows : if a value of 20k gauss is assumed for the fringe field strength at the pole pieces of the magnetic lens, a value of 2 kv is assumed for the kinetic energy of the neutral particles, a value of 4 mm is assumed for the spacing of the pole pieces of the magnetic lens, a value of 200 mm is assumed for the path length of the neutral particles within the influencing range of the magnetic induction, and a value of 500 mm is assumed for l up to the z coordinate of that plane in which the deflection y a is measured, and further assuming a value 3 / 2 for the magnetic quantum number m j and a value of 2 for the lande factor g j, the deflection | y a | is approximately 5 m. in practice, because of the small raster field of the beam deflection lens, a laser - controlled mechanically movable specimen table is required for the workpiece. a magnetic six - pole lens which may be employed in a beam lens for varying the beam cross - section is shown in fig1. the magnetic six - pole lens is disposed in the x - y plane and has a yoke jo with six pole pieces 1 through 6 each having an excitation winding e. the following currents flow in the excitation windings e of the individual pole pieces : # # equ10 # # half the distance between the pole pieces 1 through 6 is referenced a. the azimuthal angle is measured from the positive x - semiaxis proceeding toward the positive y - semiaxis. the winding currents are proportional to the coefficients of the scalar magnetic potential, that is, the winding currents having a specific index are respectively proportional to the coefficient having the same index. the scalar magnetic potential is then of the following form : # # equ11 # # in the sample embodiment, the magnetic induction and the magnetic field of a magnetic six - pole lens as shown in fig1 are composed of three terms : a dipole field far in the y - direction alignment of the beam particles, a quadrupole field for beam deflection variable in strength and azimuthal position, and an azimuthally fixed six - pole field for beam focusing as derived and specified above : # # equ12 # # a magnetic eight - pole lens which can be employed in the vario - shaped beam deflection lens disclosed herein is shown in fig2. the magnetic eight - pole lens shown in fig2 is again disposed in the x - y plane, and has a yoke jo and eight pole pieces 1 through 8, each having an excitation winding e. the following winding currents flow into the excitation windings e of the pole pieces 1 through 8 : # # equ13 # # the winding currents i i for the windings shown in fig2 have the same relationship to the scalar magnetic potential and to the magnetic induction and to the magnetic field as the corresponding winding currents for the six - pole arrangement shown in fig1. the component currents proportional to i is generate a dipole field for alignment of the magnetic dipole moment of the beam particles in the y - direction. the component currents proportional to i 2c or i 2s generate a quadrupole field for deflection of the atom beam in the x - and y - directions which is adjustable in strength and azimuthal position. the component currents proportional to i 3s generate a six - pole field fixed in azimuthal position by means of which the particle beam can be focused in one section and defocused in the other section. a schematic representation for a vario - shaped beam deflection lens for neutral particles is shown in fig3 a and fig3 b. fig3 a shows a section in the x - z plane and fig3 b shows a section in the y - z plane. a neutral particle beam n traverses a beam diaphragm f and is caused thereby to expand conically in the z - direction exhibiting an angle. the neutral particle beam n then traverses a system s consisting of at least two lenses l, which may be six - pole lenses as shown in fig1 or eight - pole lenses as shown in fig2. as indicated by the dashed lines, the system s may be comprised of three such lenses or four such lenses as well without departing from the inventive concept disclosed and claimed herein. the nondeflected shaped particle beam probe su is conically focused on a subject, such as a workpiece. the angles of this cone in the two sections are x and y respectively. the two primary enlargements v x and v y are also indicated according to the relationships v x = / x and v y = / y. the deflected shaped beam probe sg can exhibit any designed deflection coordinates x a, y a. although modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art, it is the intention of the inventor to embody within the patent warranted hereon all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of his contribution to the art.","an apparatus for deflecting and focusing a beam of neutral particles for operating on extremely small workpieces , such as for doping or inscribing micro -

"referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, fig1 and 2 illustrate in accordance with the present invention a system 10 for testing a device under test ( dut ) 12 following manufacture of the dut to determine whether or not the ics ( not shown ) and / or particular microelectronic devices aboard the dut function within design tolerances. as described below, system 10 allows dut 12 to be tested under design power conditions and without the need to test each probe pad 14 a - f to determine whether or not the contact resistance at each probe pad is within an acceptable range prior to performing operational testing of the dut. dut 12 comprises a plurality of probe pads 14 a - f, which permit testing of the various microelectronic devices ( not shown ) contained within the dut. dut 12 may be a semiconductor - and / or superconductor - based device comprising any one or more of various microelectronic devices such as memory ( e. g., dram or sram ) and logic ( e. g., asics, microcontrollers, microprocessors, and fpgas ), among others. preferably, dut 12 is tested while it is a die on a wafer ( not shown ). however, dut may be tested after dicing. system 10 is particularly suited for use with microelectronic devices having copper - based metallurgy, which is readily subject to test degradation due to buildup of copper oxide films on probe pads as well as test probes. however, system 12 may be used to test microelectronic devices utilizing conductors made of other materials, such as aluminum. in the embodiment shown, probe pads 14 a - f are arranged in a linear array. however, probe pads 14 a - f may be arranged in any configuration suited to the particular architecture of dut 12. probe pads 14 a - f are connected to the various structures contained in dut 12 by wires 16 ( fig2 ) formed within dut during manufacturing. one skilled in the art will appreciate the variety of types and structures of duts that may be tested using a system of the present invention. system 10 generally comprises a probe card 18, a plurality of power supplies 20, a plurality of sensing instruments 22 and a switch matrix 24 connecting the probe card to the power supplies and sensing instruments. probe card 18 comprises a substrate 26 having an opening 28 through which extend a plurality of sensing probes 30 a - f and a plurality of forcing probes 32 a - f. sensing and forcing probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f are preferably made of tungsten or other suitable refractory metals and alloys thereof, and are attached at their proximal ends 34 ( fig2 ) to substrate 26 at upper surface 36. in alternative embodiments, probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f may be attached to lower surface 38 of substrate 26. sensing and forcing probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f cantilever first toward and then through opening 28 such that when the sensing and forcing probes are in contact with one or more corresponding probe pads 14 a - f, lower surface 38 of substrate 26 is spaced from dut 12. each pair of substantially opposing sensing and forcing probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f contacts a corresponding probe pad 14 a - f during testing of dut 12. accordingly, distal ends 40 of substantially opposing sensing and forcing probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f are located proximate one another but are separated by a sufficient distance such that they do not contact one another at any time, and particularly when brought into contact with probe pad 14 when the contact force between the probes and the probe pads may tend to cause the distal ends of the probes to displace toward one another. each probe 30 a - f, 32 a - f is in electrical communication with a wire conductor 42 patterned onto the upper surface 36 of substrate 26. conductors 42 connect probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f to a corresponding one of a pair of interface connection points 44, each of which is in electrical communication with switch matrix 24 via a parallel conductor cable 46 containing an electrically isolated conductor for each corresponding forcing probe or sensing probe. although probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f are connected to switch matrix 24 in the manner shown, one skilled in the are will appreciate the variety of ways of electrically interconnecting the probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f and switch matrix 24 such that each probe has a dedicated connection to the switch matrix. sensing probes 30 a - f and forcing probes 32 a - f are suitably arranged in a pair of linear arrays to match the linear array of probe pads 14 a - f. one skilled in the art will recognize that sensing probes 30 and forcing probes 32 may be arranged in any configuration that suits the arrangement of corresponding probe pad 14. in addition, although probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f are shown as being needle - type probes, they may be other types of probes, such as vane probes or whisker probes. in a presently preferred embodiment, probe card 18 comprises a 1 25 linear array of sensing probes 30 and a 1 25 linear array of forcing probes 32. however, for clarity and simplicity, probe card is shown containing only a 1 6 linear array of sensing probes 30 a - f and a 1 6 linear array of forcing probes 32 a - f. one skilled in the art will recognize that any number of sensing probes 30 and forcing probes 32 may be provided. in the embodiment of system 10 shown in fig1 power supplies 20 and sensing instruments 22 are preferably grouped into four source measurement units ( smus ) 48 a - d and two voltage supply units ( vsus ) 50 a - b. each smu 48 comprises one power supply 20 and one sensing instrument 22 that contains a voltmeter 52 and a current meter 54. each vsu 50 comprises one power supply 20 and one sensing instrument 22 that contain one voltmeter 52. each smu 48 a - d and vsu 50 a - b contains a feedback controller 56 for allowing each power supply 20 to provide a variable strength output signal to a corresponding one of the forcing probes 32 a - f. the strength of the output signal from each power supply 20 is dependent upon the magnitude of the voltage measured by corresponding voltmeter 52 contained in the same smu 48 a - d or vsu 50 a - b. the functions of smus 48 a - d and vsus 50 a - b are more particularly described below in connection with a description of the operation of system 10. in a preferred embodiment, which is generally illustrated in fig1 smus 48 a - d and vsus 50 a - b may form a single equipment package, such as a semiconductor parameter analyzer model no. hp 4155 b available from hewlett packard, palo alto, calif. although power supplies 20, sensing instruments 22 and feedback controllers 56 are grouped as smus 48 a - d and vsus 50 a - b, one skilled in art will understand that these components may be stand - alone components connected to one another either directly or through one or more other components, such as a system controller ( not shown ), e. g., a central processing unit, to provide the necessary functions described below. in addition, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the particular numbers of smus 48 and vsus 50 shown are illustrative only. any number of smus 48 and vsus 50 may be used to suit a particular application. each power supply 20 and each sensing instrument 22 is independently connected to switch matrix 24, which allows each probe 30 a - f, 32 a - f to be connected to one of the power supplies, and one of the sensing instruments or ground 58 as required by a particular test. one skilled in the art will readily understand the structure, operation and function of switch matrix 24, and thus these aspects need not be described in detail herein. in a preferred embodiment, switch matrix may be a keithley model no. 707 available from keithley instruments inc., cleveland, ohio. if system 10 is not configurable, i. e., each probe 30 a - f, 32 a - f is permanently connected to a particular power supply 20, sensing instrument 22 or ground 58, switch matrix 24 may be eliminated from the system. the function of smus 48 a - d and vsus 50 a - b will become readily apparent in light of the following example. in this example, dut 12 contains a plurality of fets ( not shown ) and other microelectronic devices ( not shown ). as known to those skilled in the art, an fet is generally characterized as a four terminal device. these four terminals are : ( 1 ) a drain ; ( 2 ) a source ; ( 3 ) a gate ; and ( 4 ) a substrate. during testing, it is desirable to test an fet at conditions as close as practicable to the conditions it will experience during normal operation of the dut 12 when installed in its intended operating environment. accordingly, the performance of fet should be modeled as accurately as possible with respect to design / operating conditions. one test that may be performed on the fet under test is to measure the channel current between the source and drain at various gate and substrate bias voltages while the bias voltages at the source and drain remain constant. in this manner, a performance graph of channel current versus gate voltage may be obtained. to perform such a test, probe pads 14 a - f of dut 12 are connected to the following terminals : probe pad 14 a is connected to the drain of the fet under test ; probe pad 14 b is connected to the source of the fet under test ; probe pad 14 c is connected to the gate of the fet under test ; probe pad 14 d is connected to the substrate of fet under test ; probe pad 14 e is connected to the gate of an fet adjacent the fet under test ; and probe pad 14 f is connected to the drain of the fet adjacent the fet under test. accordingly, to test the fet under test, probe card 18 is moved toward dut 12 until probes 30 a - f, 32 a - f contact the respective probe pads 14 a - f, and switch matrix 24 is configured so that : smu 48 a is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 a ; smu 48 b is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 b ; smu 48 c is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 c ; smu 48 d is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 d ; vsu 50 a is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 e ; and vsu 50 b is in electrical communication with probe pad 14 f. when switch matrix 24 has been properly set, a test upon dut 12 to measure the performance of the fet under test may be performed as follows. in this example, each of the bias voltages and ranges of bias voltages experienced by the particular element of the fet under test is equivalent to the corresponding design voltage or range of voltage for that particular element. during the test, it is desired accomplish the following : bias the drain of the fet under test at + 2 volts ; ground the source of the fet under test so that it remains at zero volts ; bias the gate of the fet under test in a range of 0 volts to + 2 volts in volt increments ; bias the substrate of the fet under test in a range of 0 volts to 2 volts in volt increments in sync with the biasing of the gate ; bias the gate of the fet adjacent the fet under test to + 10 volts, which closes the gate of the adjacent fet ; ground the drain of the fet adjacent the fet under test ; and measure the channel current of the fet under test at each of the foregoing volt increments. to begin the test, power supply 20 of smu 48 a is energized. at first, a low power forcing signal is sent to corresponding forcing probe 32 a in contact with probe pad 14 a such that the voltage sensed at sensing probe 30 a in contact with probe pad 14 a by voltmeter 52 of of smu 48 a is less than + 2 volts. feedback controller 56 within smu 48 a sends a feedback signal to power supply 20 of smu 48 a that increases the magnitude of the forcing signal sent to forcing probe 14 a. the feedback process continues until voltage meter 20 of smu 48 a indicates a voltage of + 2 volts. depending upon the amount of contact resistance between forcing probe 32 a and probe pad 14 a due to contamination on the probe pad or the forcing probe, the actual voltage applied to the forcing probe may be in a range ofjust over + 2 volts to about + 4 volts. the impedance of the sensing probe 30 a, however, is relatively large, e. g., and is typically on the order of 106 ohms. such a high impedance renders the contact resistance between probe pad 14 a and sensing probe 30 a negligible. thus, when the voltage measured at voltmeter 52 of smu 48 a is + 2 volts, the drain of the fet under test is biased at substantially + 2 volts. this voltage is held constant during the entire test. power supply 20 of smu 48 b, and therefore forcing probe 32 b and the source of the fet under test, is grounded, e. g., to ground 58. thus, the voltage measured at voltmeter 52 of smu 48 b is zero. ground at the source of the fet under test is maintained during the entire test. power supplies 20 of smus 48 c, 48 d are energized in a manner similar to the power supply of smu 48 a, exceptto different voltages. that is, the voltages at sensing probes 30 c, 30 d are measured at corresponding voltmeters 52 of smus 48 c, 48 d and forcing signals from corresponding power supplies 20 are adjusted accordingly via feedback from the voltmeters. feedback adjustment of the forcing signals is performed for each volt increment in the desired range. in this manner, the gate and substrate of fet under test are biased in substantially the desired volt increments. similar to power supply 20 of smu 48 a, the power supply of vsu 50 a is energized and adjusted via corresponding feedback controller 56 based upon a signal from voltmeter 52 contained in vsu 50 a until the voltage measured by the voltmeter is + 10 volts. in this manner, the gate of the fet adjacent the fet under test is biased to + 10 volts to close the gate. the + 10 volt bias is maintained during the entire testing of dut 12. power supply 20 of vsu 50 b is grounded, e. g., to ground 58 during the test. grounding power supply 20 of vsu 50 b maintains the drain of adjacent gate at zero volts to reduce noise in the measured signals. as mentioned above, the goal of the test of the present example is to measure the channel current in the fet at volt increments in the bias voltages applied to the gate and substrate of fet. thus, at each volt increment, one, the other or both current meters 54 of smus 48 a, 48 b may be used to measure the channel current from the source of the fet under test to the drain of the fet under test. as will be understood by one skilled in the art, each smu 48 not used to measure current could be replaced with a vsu 50 or a variable power supply that does not have a voltmeter. also, all vsus 50 could be replaced with smus 48 such that system 10 only includes smus, although this may unnecessarily increase the total cost of the system. all that is required under the present invention is that each pair of forcing probes 32 and sensing probes 30 used to apply a particular voltage be in suitable electrical communication with a variable power supply capable of adjusting the magnitude of the electrical signal applied to the respective forcing probe based upon a signal sensed at corresponding sensing probe. while system 10 has been described in the context of testing an fet in a dut 12, the invention is not so limited. system 10 is particularly suited for testing elements of any microelectronic device where probe pad contact resistance may adversely affect test results, e. g., where the elements, such as abi - polar devices, tested have relatively low resistance and, therefore, draw a relatively high current. such elements may be part of any of a number of microelectronic devices, such as the logic devices and memory devices mentioned above. while the present invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments, it will be understood that it is not so limited. on the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.","a system for and method of testing a device under test having a plurality of probe pads utilizing a dual probe technique to overcome contact resistance that may be present . the

"in fig1 an internal combustion engine 10 is connected with a battery 13 through a starter 11 and an ignition switch 12. the generator 14 which is driven by it during running of the internal combustion engine supplies the electrical energy which is required for the vehicle electrical system. in a control device 15 the computations required for the control and regulation of the internal combustion engine are performed. a voltage measuring device 16, for example a volt meter, or a voltage measuring device integrated in the control device measures the vehicle electrical system voltage u b at any location or the battery voltage between the battery terminals and supplies a voltage measuring value to the control device 15. a rotational speed sensor 17, for example a non - inductive rotational speed sensor, measures the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine and supplies to the control device 15 a signal which depends on this rotational speed. after closing of the ignition switch 12, the starter 11 rotates a not shown crank shaft of the internal combustion engine 10. simultaneously, the generator 14 starts to rotate. during engagement of the starter it requires a great electrical energy. the vehicle electrical system voltage u b which normally is regulated to a constant value exhibits a steep break due to the high load. it however increases more or less depending on the outer conditions such as temperature and charging condition of the battery. in a further course of the starting process, the vehicle electrical system u b shows pronounced oscillations with voltage maximum and voltage minimum. when the motor is started, the starting process is ended and the vehicle electrical system voltage increases. the generator 14 outputs power to the system, up to the nominal value. in fig2 a typical course of the vehicle electrical system voltage u b is shown before and after an unsuccessful starting process. fig2 shows voltage values and respectively voltage differences as well as different times required for the evaluation. u1 identifies a first voltage difference. its value is selected so that it is smaller than an expected voltage break but greater than expected voltage changes during switching - on of another electrical consumer which loads the battery. u2 identifies a second voltage difference which is selected so that it is reliably greater than the expected voltage difference between two successive voltage measuring values in time sequence of the testing, during the testing of the oscillating voltage. u3 identifies a voltage difference which is reliably smaller than the difference between a maximum and subsequent minimum of the voltage oscillations. the times requires for the evaluation are identified with t0 to t3. t0 is a waiting time within which the voltage break of the vehicle electrical system must decrease by the amount u1 ( steepness ). t1 is a delay time which starts running after the recognition of the first voltage break. the time t2 starts after elapsing of the time t1. within the time t2 it is tested whether a maximum of the voltage oscillations occurs. after recognizing such a maximum the time t3 starts to run. the times t2 and t3 overlap. within the time t3 it is tested whether a maximum of the voltage oscillations occurs. the times t2 and t3 are waiting times. with the help of the so defined voltage differences and respectively times, an evaluation of the battery voltage course is possible. suitable values for the voltage differences and the times are fixed as below : the testing rate for the vehicle electrical system voltage amounts to 10 milliseconds. the operation of the device for monitoring a rotational speed sensor can be understood from the flow diagram shown in fig3. in the step 24 the program is started. in the step 25 it is tested whether sufficient rotational speed signals are recognized. when sufficient rotational speed signals are recognized, the rotational speed sensor operates in an orderly fashion. it is decided with & # 34 ; yes & # 34 ; and with a step 26 and eventually inputted rotational speed sensor error is cleared from the error storage. in a subsequent step 27 the testing ends. if in the step 25 & # 34 ; no & # 34 ; is recognized, the rotational speed sensor 17 supplies no rotational signal or at least a not sufficient rotational signal. in a step 28 the battery voltage u b is read, the last three values are stored. in the step 29 it is verified whether the voltage break of the starting process was already recognized. for this purpose it is verified in the step 29 whether the vehicle electrical system voltage lowers from its normal value u b over the time period t0 by at least a value u1 ( steepness ). if in the step 29 it is determined that the voltage break was not recognized, & # 34 ; no & # 34 ; is decided. by a step 30 which activates the testing due to the time sequence the maximum 10 ms is expected, and the program is again restarted. if to the contrary in the step 29 the voltage break is already recognized, a step 31 is activated. in this step it is inquired whether the delay time t1 was started. if it is not the case, in a step 32 the delay time t1 is started. then in a step 33 it is verified whether the delay time is already elapsed. when the step 21 recognizes that the delay time was already once started, the direct step 33 is activated. in the step 33 it is recognized that the delay time is not expired. by step 30 the step 25 is again activated, and it is inquired whether sufficient rotational speed signals are recognized meantime. when the step 33 determines that the delay time t1 expired, it is tested in the step 34 whether the waiting time for the recognition of a voltage maximum is once started. if it is not the case, in the step 35 the waiting time t2 for the occurrence of a voltage maximum is started. if in the step 34 it is recognized that the waiting time t2 for the recognition of a voltage maximum is already started or this time t2 was started in the step 35, it is tested in the step 36 whether the waiting time t2 for the maximum speed is expired. if in the step 36 it is recognized that the waiting time t2 for the occurrence of voltage maximum is expired, the further program run ends. a reset in the step 37 is performed. the rotational speed sensor test is again started by the step 30 after maximum 10 ms. if, to the contrary, in the step 36 it is recognized that the waiting time t2 is not expired, in the step 38 it is tested whether the voltage difference of both stored voltage values is greater than u2. when this is the case, a reset is performed, and by step 39 and 30 the rotational speed sensor test is again started. if in the step 38 it is recognized that the voltage change is not too high, in the step 40 it is tested whether a valid voltage maximum is found. for this purpose it is tested whether a voltage value u b0 is smaller than the next u b1 and is greater than the next voltage value u b2. if a valid voltage maximum is found, in the step 41 it is tested whether the waiting time t3 for a voltage maximum runs. if to the contrary in step 40 no valid voltage maximum was recognized, in the step 30 the step 25 is again started and it is tested whether sufficient rotational speed signals were recognized. if in the step 41 it is determined that the waiting time t2 for the occurrence of a voltage minimum does not run, then in the step 42 the time t3 for the occurrence of a voltage minimum is started and simultaneously the waiting time t2 for the occurrence of a voltage maximum is maintained. when the waiting time for a voltage minimum runs, it is tested in the step 43 whether the waiting time t2 is expired. if this time expired, a reset is performed in the step 47 and the rotational speed test is again started by the step 30. if the waiting time t3 for a voltage minimum is not expired, in the step 44 it is tested whether a valid voltage minimum is found. for this purpose it is tested whether the condition that the vehicle electrical system voltage u b0 is greater than the next value of the vehicle electrical system voltage u b1 and this is smaller than the next value of the vehicle electrical system voltage u b2. when this condition is not fulfilled, the rotational speed sensor test starts again by the step 30. if this condition is fulfilled, then a valid voltage minimum is found. it is recognized in a step 45 as rotational speed sensor error and in some cases is inputted in the error storage. the rotational speed sensor test is ended after this in the step 46. in the flow diagram shown in fig3 for the rotational speed sensor test, for the recognition of a rotational speed sensor error, the following conditions must be fulfilled : in the step 25 it must be recognized that not sufficient rotational speed signals are supplied to the control device. in the step 29 a voltage break

features, aspects and objects of the invention can be obtained from a review of the figures and the claims. separate and simultaneous irradiation : the light source subsystem provides sufficient power to irradiate linear arrays and 2 - d arrays of analysis wells or spots in parallel for high density applications. modulation : simple electronics can be used to modulate the light source subsystem at mhz rates. this capability allows for their use in analyses conducted in ambient light conditions. analyses can be performed that discriminate against background signals and produce enhanced signal to noise ratios. moisture and temperature insensitivity : this is particularly important for remote sensing applications. the light source subsystem is stable for a very broad range of environmental testing conditions. low heat production : analytical complications associated with heat generated by non light source subsystem are eliminated. this is particularly important for biological analyses. stability and robustness : the color purity and intensity of the light source subsystem light output doesn & # 39 ; t change as a function of how intensely they are driven nor does it change over time. modulation rates up to and even exceeding mhz can be achieved by modulating the excitation source used to activate our glass. in an embodiment of the invention, leds are used to excite the luminescent material. therefore, modulating the led will result in modulation of the light source output. the circuitry for modulating an led is well known and typically consists of a square wave, sinusoidal wave or a pulse generator. the output of the generator is then fed to a transistor amplifier circuit which drives the led. it is to be understood that other embodiments of the invention can

"referring to fig1, a recommendation system 100 provides recommendations 110 of items to users 106 in a user population 105. the system is applicable to various domains of items. in the discussion below movies are used as an example domain. the approach also applies, for example, to music albums / cds, movies and tv shows on broadcast or subscriber networks, games, books, news, apparel, recreational travel, and restaurants. in the first version of the system described below, all items belong to only one domain. extensions to recommendation across multiple domains are feasible. the system maintains a state of knowledge 130 for items that can be recommended and for users for whom recommendations can be made. a scorer 125 uses this knowledge to generate expected ratings 120 for particular items and particular users. based on the expected ratings, a recommender 115 produces recommendations 110 for particular users 106, generally attempting to recommend items that the user would value highly. to generate a recommendation 110 of items for a user 106, recommendation system 100 draws upon that user & # 39 ; s history of use of the system, and the history of use of the system by other users. over time the system receives ratings 145 for items that users are familiar with. for example, a user can provide a rating for a movie that he or she has seen, possibly after that movie was previously recommended to that user by the system. the recommendation system also supports an elicitation mode in which ratings for items are elicited from a user, for example, by presenting a short list of items in an initial enrollment phase for the user and asking the user to rate those items with which he or she is familiar or allowing the user to supply a list of favorites. additional information about a user is also typically elicited. for example, the user & # 39 ; s demographics and the user & # 39 ; s explicit likes and dislikes on selected item attributes are elicited. these elicitation questions are selected to maximize the expected value of the information about the user & # 39 ; s preferences taking into account the effort required to elicit the answers from the user. for example, a user may find that it takes more effort to answer a question that asks how much he or she likes something as compared to a question that asks how often that user does a specific activity. the elicitation mode yields elicitations 150. ratings 145 and elicitations 150 for all users of the system are included in an overall history 140 of the system. a state updater 135 updates the state of knowledge 130 using this history. this updating procedure makes use of statistical techniques, including statistical regression and bayesian parameter estimation techniques. recommendation system 100 makes use of explicit and implicit ( latent ) attributes of the recommendable items. item data 165 includes explicit information about these recommendable items. for example, for movies, such explicit information includes the director, actors, year of release, etc. an item attributizer 160 uses item data 165 to set parameters of the state of knowledge 130 associated with the items. item attributizer 160 estimates latent attributes of the items that are not explicit in item data 165. users are indexed by n which ranges from 1 to n. each user belongs to one of a disjoint set of d cohorts, indexed by d. the system can be configured for various definitions of cohorts. for example, cohorts can be based on demographics of the users such as age or sex and on explicitly announced tastes on key broad characteristics of the items. alternatively, latent cohort classes can be statistically determined based on a weighted composite of demographics and explicitly announced tastes. the number and specifications of cohorts are chosen according to statistical criteria, such as to balance adequacy of observations per cohort, homogeneity within cohort, or heterogeneity between cohorts. for simplicity of exposition below, the cohort index d is suppressed in some equations and each user is assumed assigned on only one cohort. the set of users belonging to cohort d is denoted by d d. the system can be configured to not use separate cohorts in recommending items by essentially considering only a single cohort with d = 1. referring to fig2, state of knowledge 130 includes state of knowledge of items 210, state of knowledge of users 240, and state of knowledge of cohorts 270. state of knowledge of items 210 includes separate item data 220 for each of the i recommendable items. data 220 for each item i includes k attributes, x ik, which are represented as a k - dimensional vector, x i 230. each x ik is a numeric quantity, such as a binary number indicating presence or absence of a particular attribute, a scalar quantity that indicates the degree to which a particular attribute is present, or a scalar quantity that indicates the intensity of the attribute. data 220 for each item i also includes v explicit features, v ik, which are represented as a v - dimensional vector, v i 232. as is discussed further below, some attributes x ik are deterministic functions of these explicit features and are termed explicit attributes, while other of the attributes x ik are estimated by item attributizer 160 based on explicit features of that item or of other items, and based on expert knowledge of the domain. for movies, examples of explicit features and attributes are the year of original release, its mpaa rating and the reasons for the rating, the primary language of the dialog, keywords in a description or summary of the plot, production / distribution studio, and classification into genres such as a romantic comedy or action sci - fi. examples of latent attributes are a degree of humor, of thoughtfulness, and of violence, which are estimated from the explicit features. state of knowledge of users 240 includes separate user data 250 for each of the n users. data for each user n includes an explicit user preference z nk for one or more attributes k. the set of preferences is represented as a k - dimensional vector, z n 265. preference z nk indicates the liking of attribute k by user n relative to the typical person in the user & # 39 ; s cohort. attributes for which the user has not expressed a preference are represented by a zero value of z nk. a positive ( larger ) value z nk corresponds to higher preference ( liking ) relative to the cohort, and a negative ( smaller ) z nk corresponds to a preference against ( dislike ) for the attribute relative to the cohort. data 250 for each user n also includes statistically estimated parameters n 260. these parameters include a scalar quantity n 262 and a k - dimensional vector n 264 that represent the estimated ( expected ) taste of the user relative to the cohort which is not accounted for by their explicit preference. parameters n 262 and n 264, together with the user & # 39 ; s explicit preference z n 265, are used by scorer 125 in mapping an item & # 39 ; s attributes x i 230 to an expected rating of that item by that user. statistical parameters 265 for a user also include a v + 1 dimensional vector n 266 that are used by scorer 125 in weighting a combination of an expected rating for the item for the cohort to which the user belongs as well as explicit features v i 232 to the expected rating of that item by that user. statistical parameters n 260 are represented as the stacked vector n = [ n, n, n ] of the components described above. user data 250 also includes parameters characterizing the accuracy or uncertainty of the estimated parameters n in the form of a precision ( inverse covariance ) matrix p n 268. this precision matrix is used by state updater 135 in updating estimated parameters 260, and optionally by scorer 125 in evaluating an accuracy or uncertainty of the expected ratings it generates. state of knowledge of cohorts 270 includes separate cohort data 280 for each of the d cohorts. this data includes a number of statistically estimated parameters that are associated with the cohort as a whole. a vector of regression coefficients p d 290, which is of dimension 1 + k + v, is used by scorer 125 to map a stacked vector ( 1, x i, v i ) for an item i to a rating score for that item that is appropriate for the cohort as a whole. the cohort data also includes a k - dimensional vector d 292 that is used to weight the explicit preferences of members of that cohort. that is, if a user n has expressed an explicit preference for attribute k of z nk, and user n is in cohort d, then that product { tilde over ( z ) } nk = z nk dk is used by scorer 125 in determining the contribution based on the user & # 39 ; s explicit ratings as compared to the contribution based on other estimated parameters, and in determining the relative contribution of explicit preferences for different of the k attributes. other parameters, including d 296, d 297, and d 294, are estimated by state updater 135 and used by scorer 125 in computing a contribution of a user & # 39 ; s cohort to the estimated rating. cohort data 280 also includes a cohort rating or fixed - effect vector f 298, whose elements are the expected rating f id of each item i based on the sample histories of the cohort d that best represent a typical user of the cohort. finally, cohort data 280 includes a prior precision matrix p d 299, which characterizes a prior distribution for the estimated user parameters i 280, which are used by state updater 125 as a starting point of a procedure to personalize parameters to an individual user. a discussion of how the various variables in state of knowledge 130 are determined is deferred to section 4 in which details of state updater 125 are presented. recommendation system 100 employs a model that associates a numeric variable r in to represent the cardinal preference of user n for item i. here r in can be interpreted as the rating the user has already given, or the unknown rating the user would give the item. in a specific version of the system that was implemented for validating experiments, these rating lie on a 1 to 5 scale. for eliciting ratings from the user, the system maps descriptive phrases, such as great or ok or poor, to appropriate integers in the valid scale. for an item i that a user n has not yet rated, recommendation system 100 treats the unknown rating r in that user n would give item i as a random variable. the decision on whether to recommend item i to user n at time t is based on state of knowledge 130 at that time. scorer 125 computes an expected rating { circumflex over ( r ) } in 120, based on the estimated statistical properties of r in, and also computes a confidence or accuracy of that estimate. the scorer 125 computes { circumflex over ( r ) } in based on a number of sub - estimates that include : a. a cohort - based prior rating f id 310, which is an element of f 298. b. an explicit deviation 320 of user i & # 39 ; s rating relative to the representative or prototypical user of the cohort d to which the user belongs that is associated with explicitly elicited deviations in preferences for the attributes x i 230 for the item. these deviations are represented in the vector z n 265. an estimated mapping vector d 292 for the cohort translates the deviations in preferences into rating units. c. an inferred deviation 330 of user i & # 39 ; s rating ( relative to the representative or prototypical user of the cohort d to which the user belongs taking into account the elicited deviations in preferences ) arises from any non - zero personal parameters, n 262, n 264, and n 266, in the state of knowledge of users 130. such non - zero estimates of the personal parameters are inferred from the history of ratings of the user i. this inferred ratings deviation is the inner product of the personal parameters with the attributes x i 230, the cohort effect term f id 298, and features v i 232. the specific computation performed by scorer 125 is expressed as : r ^ in = ( f id ) + ( z ~ n x i ) + ( n + n x i + n [ f id, v i ] ) = ( f id ) + ( z ~ n x i ) + ( n [ 1, x i, f id, v i ] ) ( 1 ) here the three parenthetical terms correspond to the three components ( a. - c. ) above, and { tilde over ( z ) } n diag ( z n ) d ( i. e., the direct product of z n and d ). note that multiplication of vectors denotes inner products of the vectors. as discussed further below, f id is computed as a combination of a number of cohort - based estimates as follows : f id = d + id { overscore ( r ) } i, d + id { overscore ( r ) } i, \ d + ( 1 id id ) p d [ 1, x i, v i ] ( 2 ) r _ i, d = m d d r im / n i, d is the average rating for item i for users of the cohort, and { overscore ( r ) } i, \ d is the average rating for users outside the cohort. as discussed further below, parameters id and id depend on an underlying set of estimated parameters d = ( 1,. . . , 4 ) 294. along with the expected rating for an item, scorer 125 also provides an estimate of the accuracy of the expected rating, based on an estimate of the variance using the rating model. in particular, an expected rating { circumflex over ( r ) } in is associated with a variance of the estimate in 2 which is computed using the posterior precision of the user & # 39 ; s parameter estimates. scorer 125 does not necessarily score all items in the domain. based on preferences elicited from a user, the item set is filtered based on the attributes for the item by the scorer before passing computing the expected ratings for the items and passing them to the recommender. cohort data 280 for each cohort d includes a cohort effect term f id for each item i. if there are sufficient ratings of item i by users belonging to d d, whose number is denoted by n i, d, then the cohort effect term f id can be efficiently estimated by the sample & # 39 ; s average rating, r _ i, d = m d d r im / n i, d. in many instances, n i, d is insufficient and the value of the cohort effect term of the rating is only imprecisely estimated by the sample average of the ratings by other users in the cohort. a better finite - sample estimate of f id is obtained by combining the estimate due to { overscore ( r ) } i, d with alternative estimators, which may not be as asymptotically efficient or perhaps not even converge. one alternative estimator employs ratings of item i by users outside of cohort d. let n i, \ d denote the number of such ratings available for item i. suppose the cohorts are exchangeable in the sense that inference is invariant to permutation of cohort suffixes. this alternative estimator, the sample average of these n i, \ d rating for item i users outside cohort, is denoted { overscore ( r ) } 8, \ d. a second alternative estimator is a regression of r im on [ 1, x i, v i ] yielding a vector of regression coefficients p d 290. this regression estimator is important for items that have few ratings ( possibly zero, such as for brand new items ). all the parameter for the estimators, as well as parameters that determine the relative weights of the estimators, are estimated together using the following non - linear regression equation based on the sample of all ratings from the users of cohort d : r im = d + id { overscore ( r ) } i, d \ m + id { overscore ( r ) } i, \ d + ( 1 id id ) [ 1, x i, v i ] p d + x i diag ( z m ) d + u im ( 3 ) here { overscore ( r ) } i, d \ m is the mean rating for item i by users in cohort d excluding user m ; p d is interpretable as the vector of coefficients associated with the item & # 39 ; s attributes that can predict the average between - item variation in ratings without using information on the ratings assigned to the items by other users ( or when some of the items for whom prediction is sought are as yet unrated ). the weights id and id are nonlinear functions of n i, d and n i, \ d which depend on the underlying set of parameters d = ( 1,. . . , 4 ) 294 : id = n i, d n i, d + 1 / ( 1 + 2 - 3 ln n i, \ d ) + 4, id = 1 / ( 1 + 2 - 3 ln n i, \ d ) n i, d + 1 / ( 1 + 2 - 3 ln n i, \ d ) + 4 the j & # 39 ; s are positive parameters to be estimated. note that the relative importance of { overscore ( r ) } i, d \ m grows with n i, d. all the parameters in equation ( 3 ) are invariant across users in the cohort d. however, with small n, d, even these parameters may not be precisely estimated. in such cases, an alternative is to impose exchangeability across cohorts for the coefficients of equation ( 3 ) and then draw strength from pooling the cohorts. modern bayesian estimation employing markov - chain monte - carlo methods are suitable with the practically valuable assumption of exchangeability. the key estimates obtained from fitting the non - linear regression ( 3 ) to the sample data, whether by classical methods for each cohort separately or by pooled bayesian estimation under assumptions of exchangeability, are : d, and the parameters that enable f id to be computed for different i. referring to fig4, state updater 135 includes a cohort regression module 430 that computes the quantities d 292, p d 290, and the four scalar components of d = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ) 294 using equation ( 2 ). based on these quantities, a cohort derived terms module 440 computes id 296 and id 297 and from those f id 298 according to equation ( 2 ). state updater 135 also includes a bayesian updater 460 that updates parameters of user data 280. in particular, bayesian updater 460 maintains an estimate n = ( n, n, n ) 260, as well as a precision matrix p n 268. the initial values of p n and n are common to all users of a cohort. the value of n is initially zero. the initial value of p n is computed by precision estimator 450, and is a component for cohort data 280, p d. the initial value of the precision matrix p n is obtained through a random coefficients implementation of equation ( 1 ) without the f id term. specifically, each user in a cohort is assumed to have coefficient that are a random draw from a fixed multivariate normal distribution whose parameters are to be estimated. in practice, the multivariate normal distribution is assumed to have a diagonal covariance matrix for simplicity. the means and the variances of the distribution are estimated using markov - chain monte - carlo methods common to empirical bayes estimation. the inverse of this estimated variance matrix is used as the initial precision matrix p n. parameters of state of users 250 are initially set when the cohort terms are updated and then incrementally updated at intervals thereafter. in the discussion below, time index t = 0 corresponds to the time of the estimation of the cohort terms, and a sequence of time indices t = 1, 2, 3. . . correspond subsequent times at which user parameters are updated. state updater 135 has three sets of modules. a first set 435, includes cohort regression module 430 and cohort derived terms module 440. these modules are executed periodically, for example, once per week. other regular or irregular intervals are optionally used, for example, every hour, day, monthly, etc. a second set 436 includes precision estimator 450. this module is generally executed less often that the others, for example, one a month. the third set 437 includes bayesian updater 460. the user parameters are updated using this module as often as whenever a user rating is received, according to the number of ratings that have not been incorporated into the estimates, or periodically such as ever hour, day, week etc. the recommendation system is based on a model that treats each unknown rating r in ( i. e., for an item i that user n has not yet rated ) as an unknown random variable. in this model random variable r in is a function of unknown parameters that are themselves treated as random variables. in this model, the user parameters n = ( n, n, n ) introduced above that are used to computer the expected rating { circumflex over ( r ) } in are estimates of those unknown parameters. in this model, the true ( unknown random ) parameter * n is distributed as a multivariate gaussian distribution with mean ( expected value ) n and covariance p n 1, which can be represented as * n n ( n, p n 1 ). r in = ( f id ) + ( { tilde over ( z ) } n x i ) + ( * n [ 1, x i, f id, v i ] ) + in ( 4 ) where in is an error term, which is not necessarily independent and identically distributed for different values of i and n. for a user n who has rated item i with a rating r in, a residual term { hacek over ( r ) } in reflects the component of the rating not accounted for by the cohort effect term, or the contribution of the user & # 39 ; s own preferences. the residual term has the form { hacek over ( r ) } in = r in ( f id ) ( { tilde over ( z ) } n x i ) = * n [ 1, x i, f id, v i ] + in as the system obtains more ratings by various users for various items, the estimate of the mean and the precision of that variable are updated. at time index t, using ratings up to time index t, the random parameters are distributed as * n n ( n ( t ), p n ( t ) ). as introduced above, prior to taking into account any ratings by user n, the random parameters are distributed as * n n ( 0, p d ), that is, n ( 0 ) = 0 and p n ( 0 ) = p d. at time index t + 1, the system has received a number of ratings of items by users n, which we denote h, that have not yet been incorporated into the estimates of the parameters n ( t ) and p n ( t ). an h - dimensional ( column ) vector { hacek over ( r ) } n is formed from the h residual terms, and the corresponding stacked vectors ( 1, x i, f id, v i ) form a h - column by 2 + k + v - row matrix a. the updated estimate of the parameters n ( t + 1 ) and p n ( t + 1 ) given { hacek over ( r ) } n and a and the prior parameter values n ( t ) and p n ( t ) are found by the bayesian formulas : n ( t + 1 ) = ( p n ( t ) + a a ) 1 ( p n ( t ) n ( t ) + a { hacek over ( r ) } n ), p n ( t + 1 ) = p n ( t ) + a a ( 5 ) equation ( 5 ) is applied at time index t = 1 to incorporate all the user & # 39 ; s history of ratings prior to that time. for example, time index t = 1 is immediately after the update to the cohort parameters, and subsequent time indices correspond to later times when subsequent of the user & # 39 ; s ratings incorporated. in an alternative approach, equation ( 5 ) is reapplied using t = 1 repeatedly starting from the prior estimate and incorporating the user & # 39 ; s complete rating history. this alternative approach provides a mechanism for removing ratings from the user & # 39 ; s history, for example, if the user re - rates an item, or explicitly withdraws a past rating. referring to fig1 - 2, item attributizer 160 determines data 220 for each item i. as introduced above, data 220 for each item i includes k attributes, x ik, which are represented as k - dimensional vector, x i 230, and v features, v ik, which are represented as v - dimensional vector, v i 232. the specifics of the procedure used by item attributizer 160 depends, in general, on the domain of the items. the general structure of the approach is common to many domains. information available to item attributizer 160 for a particular item includes values of a number of numerical fields or variables, as well as a number of text fields. the output attribute x ik corresponds to features of item i for which a user may express an implicit or explicit preference. examples of such attributes include thoughtfulness, humor, and romance. the output features v ik may be correlated with a user & # 39 ; s preference for the item, but for which the user would not in general express an explicit preference. an example of such an attribute is the number or fraction of other users that have rated the item. in a movie domain, examples of input variables associated with a movie include its year of release, its mpaa rating, the studio that released the film, and the budget of the film. examples of text fields are plot keywords, keyword that the movie is an independent - film, text that explains the mpaa rating, and a text summary of the film. the vocabularies of the text fields are open, in the range of 5, 000 words for plot keywords and 15, 000 words for the summaries. as is described further below, the words in the text fields are stemmed and generally treated as unordered sets of stemmed words. ( ordered pairs / triplets of stemmed words can be treated as unique meta - words if appropriate. ) attributes x ik are divided into two groups : explicit attributes and latent ( implicit ) attributes. explicit attributes are deterministic functions of the inputs for an item. examples of such explicit attributes include indicator variables for the various possible mpaa ratings, an age of the film, or an indicator that it is a recent release. latent attributes are estimated from the inputs for an item using one of a number of statistical approaches. latent attributes form two groups, and a different statistical approach is used for attributes in each of the groups. one approach uses a direct mapping of the inputs to an estimate of the latent attribute, while the other approach makes use of a clustering or hierarchical approach to estimating the latent attributes in the group. in the first statistical approach, a training set of items are labeled by a person familiar with the domain with a desired value of a particular latent attribute. an example of such a latent attribute is an indication of whether the film is an independent film. for this latent variable, although an explicit attribute could be formed based on input variables for the film ( e. g., the producing / distributing studio & # 39 ; s typical style or movie budget size ), a more robust estimate is obtained by treating the attribute as latent and incorporating additional inputs. parameters of a posterior probability distribution pr ( attr. k | input i ), or equivalently the expected value of the indicator variable for the attribute, are estimated based on the training set. a logistic regression approach is used to determine this posterior probability. a robust screening process selects the input variables for the logistic regressions from the large candidate set. in the case of the independent latent attribute, pre - fixed inputs include the explicit text indicator that the movie is independent - film and the budget of the film. the value of the latent attribute for films outside the training set is then determined as the score computed by the logistic regression ( i. e., a number between 0 and 1 ) given the input variables for such items. in the second statistical approach, items are associated with clusters, and each cluster is associated with a particular vector of scores of the latent attributes. all relevant vectors of latent scores for real movies are assumed to be spanned by positively weighted combinations of the vectors associated with the clusters. this is expressed as : e ( s ik | inputs of i ) = c s ck pr ( i cluster c | inputs of i ) where s k denotes the latent score on attribute k, and e ( ) denotes the mathematical expectation. the parameters of the probability functions on the right - hand side of the equation are estimated using a training set of items. specifically, a number of items are grouped into clusters by one or more persons with knowledge of the domain, hereafter called editors. in the case of movies, approximately 1800 movies are divided into 44 clusters. for each cluster, a number of prototypical items are identified by the editors who set values of the latent attributes for those prototypical items, i. e., s ck. parameters of probability, pr ( i cluster c | inputs of i ), are estimated using a hierarchical logistic regression. the clusters are divided into a two - level hierarchy in which each cluster is uniquely assigned to a higher - level cluster by the editors. in the case of movies, the 44 clusters are divided into 6 higher - level clusters, denoted c, and the probability of membership is computed using a chain rule as pr ( cluster c | input i ) = pr ( cluster c | cluster c, input i ) pr ( cluster c | input i ) the right - hand side probabilities are estimated using a multinomial logistic regression framework. the inputs to the logistic regression are based on the numerical and categorical input variables for the item, as well as a processed form of the text fields. in order to reduce the data in the text fields, for each higher - level cluster c, each of the words in the vocabulary is categories into one of a set of discrete ( generally overlapping ) categories according to the utility of the word in discriminating between membership in that category versus membership in some other category ( i. e., a 2 - class analysis for each cluster ). the words are categorized as weak, medium, or strong. the categorization is determined by estimating parameters of a logistic function whose inputs are counts for each of the words in the vocabulary occurring in each of the text fields for an item, and the output is the probability of belonging to the cluster. strong words are identified by corresponding coefficients in the logistic regression having large ( absolute ) values, and medium and weak words are identified by corresponding coefficients having values in lower ranges. alternatively, a jackknife procedure is used to assess the strength of the words. judgments of the editors are also incorporated, for example, by adding or deleting works or changing the strength of particular words. the categories for each of the clusters are combined to form a set of overlapping categories of words. the input to the multinomial logistic function is then the count of the number of words in each text field in each of the categories ( for all the clusters ). in the movie example with 6 higher - level categories, and three categories of word strength, this results in 18 counts being input to the multinomial logistic function. in addition to these counts, additional inputs that are based on the variables for the item are added, for example, an indicator of the genre of a film. the same approach is repeated independently to compute pr ( cluster c | cluster c, input i ) for each of the clusters c. that is, this procedure for mapping the input words to a fixed number of features is repeated for each of the specific clusters, with different with different categorization of the words for each of the higher - level clusters. with c higher - level clusters, an additional c multinomial logistic regression function are determined to compute the probabilities pr ( cluster c | cluster c, input i ). note that although the training items are identified as belonging to a single cluster, in determining values for the latent attributes for an item, terms corresponding to each of the clusters contribute to the estimate of the latent attribute, weighted by the estimate of membership in each of the clusters. the v explicit features, v ik, are estimated using a similar approach as used for the attributes. in the movie domain, in one version of the system, these features are limited to deterministic functions of the inputs for an item. alternatively, procedures analogous to the estimation of latent attributes can be used to estimate additional features. referring to fig1, recommender 115 takes as inputs values of expected ratings of items by a user and creates a list of recommended items for that user. the recommender performs a number of functions that together yield the recommendation that is presented to the user. a first function relates to the difference in ranges of ratings that different users may give. for example, one user may consistently rate items higher or lower than another. that is, their average rating, or their rating on a standard set of items may differ significantly from than for other users. a user may also use a wider or narrower range of rating than other users. that is, the variance of their ratings or the sample variance of a standard set of items may differ significantly from other users. before processing the expected ratings for items produced by the scorer, the recommender normalizes the expected ratings to a universal scale by applying a user - specific multiplicative and an additive scaling to the expected ratings. the parameters of these scalings are determined to match the average and standard deviation on a standard set of items to desired target values, such as an average of 3 and a standard deviation of 1. this standard set of items is chosen such that for a chosen size of the standard set ( e. g., 20 items ) the value of the determinant of x x is maximized, where x is formed as a matrix whose columns are the attribute vectors x i for the items i in the set. this selection of standard items provides an efficient sampling of the space of items based on differences in their attribute vectors. the coefficients for this normalization process are stored with other data for the user. the normalized expected rating, and its associated normalized variance are denoted { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } in and { tilde over ( ) } in 2. a second function is performed by the scorer is to limit the items to consider based on a preconfigured floor value of the normalized expected rating. for example, items with normalized expected ratings lower than 1 are discarded. a third function performed by the recommender is to combine the normalized expected rating with its ( normalized ) variance as well as some editorial inputs to yield a recommendation score, s in. specifically, the recommendation score is computed by the recommender as : s in = { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } in 1, n { tilde over ( ) } in + 2, n x i + 3 e id the term 1, n represents a weighting of the risk introduced by an error in the rating estimate. for example, an item with a high expected rating but also a high variance in the estimate is penalized for the high variance based on this term. optionally, this term is set by the user explicitly based on a desired risk in the recommendations, or is varied as the user interacts with the system, for instance starting at a relatively high value and being reduced over time. the term 2, n represents a trust term. the inner product of this term with attributes x i is used to increase the score for popular items. one use of this term is to initially increase the recommendation score for generally popular items, thereby building trust in the user. over time, the contribution of this term is reduced. the third term 3 e id represents an editorial input. particular items can optionally have their recommendation score increased or decreased based on editorial input. for example, a new film which is expected to be popular in a cohort but for which little data is available could have the corresponding term e id set to a non - zero value. the scale factor 3 determines the degree of contribution of the editorial inputs. editorial inputs can also be used to promote particular items, or to promote relatively profitable items, or items for which there is a large inventory. when a new user first begins using the system, the system elicits information from the new user to begin the personalization process. the new user responds to a set of predetermined elicitation queries 155 producing elicitations 150, which are used as part of the history for the user that is used in estimating user - specific parameters for that user. initially, the new user is asked his or her age, sex, and optionally is asked a small number of additional questions to determine their cohort. for example, in the movie domain, an additional question related to whether the watch independent films is asked. from these initial questions, the user & # 39 ; s cohort is chosen and fixed. for each cohort, a small number of items are pre - selected and the new user is asked to rate any of these items with which he or she is familiar. these ratings initialize the user & # 39 ; s history or ratings. given the desired number of such items, with is typically set in the range of 10 - 20, the system pre - selects the items to maximize the determinant of the matrix x x where the columns of x are the stacked attribute and feature vectors ( x i v i ) for the items. the new user is also asked a number of questions, which are used to determine the value of the user & # 39 ; s preference vector z n. each question is designed to determine a value for one ( or possibly more ) of the entries in the preference vector. some preferences are used by the scorer to filter out items from the choice set, for example, if the user response never to a question such as do you ever watch horror films? in addition to these questions, some preferences are set by rule for a cohort, for example, to avoid recommending r - rated films for a teenager who does not like science fiction, based on an observation that these tastes are correlated in teenagers. the approach described above, the correlation structure of the error term in in equation ( 4 ) is not taken into account in computing the expected rating { circumflex over ( r ) } in. one or both of two additional terms are introduced based on an imposed structure of the error term that relates to closeness of different items and closeness of different users. in particular, an approach to effectively modeling and taking into account the correlation structure of the error terms is used to improve the expected rating using was can be viewed as a combination of user - based and an item - based collaborative filtering term. an expected rating { circumflex over ( r ) } in for item i and user n is modified based on actual ratings that have been provided by that user for other items j and actual ratings for item i by other users m in the same cohort. specifically, the new rating is computed as { circumflex over ( { circumflex over ( r ) } ) } in = { circumflex over ( r ) } in + j { circumflex over ( ) } ij { circumflex over ( ) } jn + m { circumflex over ( ) } mn { circumflex over ( ) } im where { circumflex over ( ) } in { circumflex over ( r ) } in r in are fitted residual values based on the expected and actual ratings. the terms = [ { circumflex over ( ) } ij ] and = [ { circumflex over ( ) } ij ] are structured to allow estimation of a relative small number of free parameters. this modeling approach is essentially equivalent to gathering the errors in in a i n - dimensional vector and forming an error covariance as e ( ) =. one approach to estimating these terms is to assume that the entries of have the form { circumflex over ( ) } ij = { circumflex over ( ) } 0 { circumflex over ( ) } ij where the terms { tilde over ( ) } ij are precomputed terms that are treated as constants, and the scalar term { circumflex over ( ) } 0 is estimated. similarly, the other term assumes that the entries of have the form { circumflex over ( ) } mn = { circumflex over ( ) } 0 { circumflex over ( ) } mn. one approach to precomputing the constants is as { tilde over ( ) } ij = | | x i x j | | where the norm is optionally computed using the absolute differences of the attributes ( l1 norm ), using a euclidean norm ( l2 norm ), or using a covariance weighted norm using a covariance is the covariance matrix of the taste parameters of the users in the cohort. in the analogous approach, the terms { tilde over ( ) } ij represent similarity between users and is computed as | | nm | |, where nm ( n + z n ) ( m + z m ). a covariance - weighted norm, nm x nm, uses x, which is the covariance matrix of the attributes of items in the domain, and the scaling idea here is that dissimilarity is more important for those tastes associated with attributes having greater variation across items ; another approach to computing the constant terms uses a bayesian regression approach using e ( { circumflex over ( ) } im | { circumflex over ( ) } jm ) = ij { circumflex over ( ) } jm. the residuals are based on all users in the same cohort who rate both items i and j, ij n ( ij 0, ) and ij 0 is specified based on prior information about the closeness of items of type i and j ( for example, the items share a known common attribute ( e. g., director of movie ) that was not included in the model & # 39 ; s x i or the preference - weighted distance between their attributes is unusually high / low ). the bayesian regression for estimating the ij - parameters may provide the best estimate but is computationally expensive. it employs { circumflex over ( ) } & # 39 ; s to ensure good estimates of the parameters associated with the error - structure of equation ( 4 ). to obtain the { circumflex over ( ) } & # 39 ; s in practice for these regressions when no preliminary ij values have been computed, the approach ignores the error - correlation structure ( i. e., ij 0 = 0 ) and compute the individual - specific idiosyncratic coefficients of equation ( 4 ) for each individual in the sample given the cohort function. the residuals from the personalized regressions are the { circumflex over ( ) } & # 39 ; s. regardless, the ij - parameters can always be conveniently pre - computed since they do not depend on user n for whom the recommendations are desired. that is, the computations of the ij - parameters are conveniently done off - line and not in real - time when specific recommendations are being sought. similarly, the bayesian regression e ( { circumflex over ( ) } jn | { circumflex over ( ) } jm ) = nm { circumflex over ( ) } jm, where the residuals are based on equation is based on all items that have been jointly rated by users m and n. the regression method may not prove as powerful here since the number of items that are rated in common by both users may be small ; moreover, since there are many users, real time computation of n regressions may be costly. to speed up the process, the users can optionally be clustered into g n groups or equivalently the matrix can be factorized with g factors. in a first alternative recommendation approach, the system described above optionally provides recommendations for a group of users. the members of the group may come from different cohorts, may have histories of rating different items, and indeed, some of the members may not have rated any items at all. the general approach to such joint recommendation is to combine the normalized expected ratings { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } in for each item for all users n in a group g. in general, in specifying the group, different members of the group are identified by the user soliciting the recommendation as more important resulting in a non - uniform weighting according to coefficients ng, where ng ng = 1. if all members of the group are equally important, the system sets the weights equal to ng = | g | 1. the normalized expected joint rating is then computed as { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } ig = ng ng { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } in joint recommendation scores s ig are then computed for each item for the group incorporating risk, trust, and editorial terms into weighting coefficients k, g where the group as a whole is treated as a composite user : s ig = { circumflex over ( { tilde over ( r ) } ) } ig 1, g { tilde over ( ) } ig + 2, g x i + 3 e ig the risk term is conveniently the standard deviation ( square root of variance ) { tilde over ( ) } ig, where the variance for the normalized estimate is computed accord to the weighted sum of individual variances of the members of the group. as with individual users, the coefficients are optionally varied over time to introduce different contributions for risk and trust terms as the users & # 39 ; confidence in the system increases with the length of their experience of the system. alternatively, the weighted combination is performed after recommendation scores for individual users s in are computed. that is, computation of a joint recommendation on behalf of one user requires accessing information about other users in the group. the system implements a two - tiered password system in which a user & # 39 ; s own information in protected by a private password. in order for another user to use that user & # 39 ; s information to derive a group recommendation, the other user requires a public password. with the public password, the other user can incorporate the user & # 39 ; s information into a group recommendation, but cannot view information such as the user & # 39 ; s history of ratings, or even generate a recommendation specifically for that user. in another alternative approach to joint recommendation, recommendations for each user are separately computed, and the recommendation for the group includes at least a best recommendation for each use in the group. similarly, items that fall below a threshold score for any user are optionally removed from the joint recommendation list for the group. a conflict between a highest scoring item for one user in the group that scores below the threshold for some other user is resolved in one of a number of ways, for example, by retaining the item as a candidate. the remaining recommendations are then included according to their weighted ratings or scores as described above. yet other alternatives include computing joint ratings from individual ratings using a variety of statistics, such as the maximum, the minimum, or the median individual ratings for the items. the groups are optionally predefined in the system, for example, corresponding to a family, a couple, or some other social unit. the system described above can be applied to identifying similar users in addition to ( or alternatively instead of ) providing recommendations of items to individuals or groups of users. the similarity between users is used to can be applied to define a user & # 39 ; s affinity group. one measure of similarity between individual users is based on a set of standard items, j. these items are chosen using the same approach as described above to determine standard items for normalizing expected ratings, except here the users are not necessarily taken from one cohort since an affinity group may draw users from multiple cohorts. for each user, a vector of expected ratings for each of the standard items is formed, and the similarity between a pair of users is defined as a distance between the vector of ratings on the standard items. for instance, a euclidean distance between the ratings vectors is used. the size of an affinity group is determined by a maximum distance between users in a group, or by a maximum size of the group. affinity groups are used for a variety of purposes. a first purpose relates to recommendations. a user can be provided with actual ( as opposed to expected ) recommendations of other members of his or her affinity group. another purpose is to request ratings for an affinity group of another user. for example, a user may want to see ratings of items from an affinity group of a well known user. another purpose is social rather than directly recommendation - related. a user may want to find other similar people, for example, to meet or communicate with. for example, in a book domain, a user may want to join a chat group of users with similar interests. computing an affinity group for a user in real time can be computationally expensive due to the computation of the pair wise user similarities. an alternative approach involves precomputing data that reduces the computation required to determine the affinity group for an individual user. one approach to precomputing such data involves mapping the rating vector on the standard items for each user into a discrete space, for example, by quantizing each rating in the rating vector, for example, into one of three levels. for example, with 10 items in the standard set, and three levels of rating, the vectors can take on one of 3 10 values. an extensible hash is constructed to map each observed combination of quantized ratings to a set of users. using this precomputed hash table, in order to compute an affinity group for a user, users with similar quantized rating vectors are located by first considering users with the identical quantized ratings. if there are insufficient users with the same quantized ratings, the least important item in the standard set is ignored and the process repeated, until there are sufficient users in the group. alternative approaches to forming affinity groups involve different similarity measures based on the individuals & # 39 ; statistical parameters. for example, differences between users & # 39 ; parameter vectors ( taking into account the precision of the estimates ) can be used. also, other forms of pre - computation of groups can be used. for example, clustering techniques ( e. g., agglomerative clustering ) can be used to identify groups that are then accessed when the affinity group for a particular user is needed. alternatively, affinity groups are limited to be within a single cohort, or within a predefined number of similar cohorts. in alternative embodiments of the system, the modeling approach described above for providing recommendations to users is used for selecting targeted advertising for those users, for example in the form of personalized on - line banner ads or paper or electronic direct mailings. in another alternative embodiment of the system, the modeling approach described above for providing recommendations to users is used to find suitable gifts for known other users. here the information is typically limited. for example, limited information on the targets for the gift may be demographics or selected explicit tastes such that the target may be explicitly or probabilistically classified into explicit or latent cohorts. in another alternative embodiment, users may be assigned to more than one cohort, and their membership may be weighted or fractional in each cohort. cohorts may be based on partitioning users by directly observable characteristics, such as demographics or tastes, or using statistical techniques such as using estimated regression models employing latent classes. latent class considerations offer two important advantages : first, latent cohorts will more fully utilize information on the user ; and, second, the number of cohorts can be significantly reduced since users are profiled by multiple membership in the latent cohorts rather than a single membership assignment. specifically, we obtain a cohort - membership model that generates user - specific probabilities for user n to belong to latent cohort d, pr ( n d d | demographics of user n, z n ). here user n & # 39 ; s explicitly elicited tastes are z n. estimates of pr ( n d d | demographics of user n, z n ) are obtained by employing a latent class regression that extends equation ( 3 ) above. while demanding, this computation is off - line and infrequent. with latent cohorts, the scorer 125 uses a modification of the inputs indicated in equation ( 1 ) : for example, f id is replaced by the weighted average d = 1 d pr ( n d | demographics, z n ) f id. for the scores, the increased burden with latent cohorts is very small, which allows the personalized recommendation system to remain very scalable. the approach described above considers a single domain of items, such as movies or books. in an alternative system, multiple domains are jointly considered by the system. in this way, a history in one domain contributes to recommendations for items in the other domain. one approach to this is to use common attribute dimensions in the explicit and latent attributes for items. it is to be understood that the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.","a method for recommending items in a domain to users , either individually or in groups , makes user of users &# 39 ; characteristics , their carefully elicited preferences , and a history of their ratings of the items are maintained in a database . users are assigned to cohorts that are constructed such that significant between -

"one or more embodiments of the present invention are described. nevertheless, it would be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the claims that follow this detailed description. this detailed description includes methods and means for managing and controlling one or more uv systems. the uvs utilize a networked swarm, or flock, awareness to allow operation of one or more uvs within a personalized augmented reality drone event. the uvs onboard systems may provide vehicle pose, object recognition, environmental interaction capabilities. the rdp parde experience is setup, configured, and initiated, from an operational control system and by a certified control pilot. the cp monitors the parde and all participants throughout for safety and real - time parde parameter modifications to maximize the experience. exemplary configurable event parameters include defining uv operating boundaries in terms of spatial geographical grids, image - triggered events, number of pilots participating, varc flight control sensitivity ( to allow users of varying skill levels to participate ), and swarm control level between pilots. these functionalities are enhanced both in precision and robustness by an outdoor distributed image network, a network of well - defined images or features which permits calculating vehicle pose to a higher degree than gps alone. during each parde, the cp continuously monitors each pilot from the ocs and controls the experience parameters to ensure optimal safety. the ocs also includes integrated communication systems to interact with current parde participants as well as local safety officials and weather information. control of the uv can be achieved by commands from the remote drone pilot or by the control pilot from the ocs control and monitoring systems, or autonomously from the ocs based on parde parameters and position of a uv within the configured parde environment. commands from the rdp and associated position of their uv in the parde environment are monitored for safety by an on - board autopilot and processor. the on - board autopilot and processor or on - board uv control system autonomously executes command overrides in event of a communications failure or inappropriate commands from the rdp in the varc. rdp control of the vehicle is additionally constrained by the user & # 39 ; s skill level, ranging from only field of view control to complete vehicle command. the rdp user experiences the parde through a virtual augmented reality cockpit. the varc provides an augmented reality ( ar ) visual and tactile experience tailored to the rdps. the varc, at its most basic embodiment may consist of virtual reality goggles for first person view from the uv and handheld uv remote controls. the full embodiment of the varc may include the following key features : remote piloting of rdps uv of choice within a defined geographical location ( air, land, and water ), a heads up display for remote piloting of the uv via fpv, integrated audio and visual interactive content superimposed on the hud, rdp control of the on - screen interactive content and camera, infrared beam targeting, or other system payload controls, integration of multiple varcs with the same uv allowing daisy chain of varcs so that multiple rdps are connected to the same uv, enjoying the same immersed parde experience, but controlling different payload systems to achieve their objectives. six degrees of cockpit motion and tactile feedback based on rdp & # 39 ; s flight control systems and real - time telemetry being received from the uv itself, and communication systems to interact with a cp when needed and with other rdps or rdcp who may be participating in the current pardes the autopilot unit receives and executes commands, as well as provides low - level environmental interaction such as vehicle stabilization by utilizing data from various sensors residing onboard the uv. this information can also be relayed to both onboard systems and ground - mounted ocs control and monitoring systems, which may provide correctional control to uvs to allow safe and objective operation. both the ground - mounted and onboard control systems may have the ability to safety check rdp commands to allow overriding a user & # 39 ; s input if deemed unsafe. this determination is based on pre - compiled site and event specific parde libraries, which may define an enforced geo - fence of allowed 3 - d volume, allowed speeds, and emergency obstacle avoidance parameters. the uv may be equipped with sensors and devices such as gps or visual and auditory sensors that provide real - time data to the onboard system and the ocs. either the onboard or gps may provide flight data information to external services such as emergency crews, as well as current parde mission plans and system status including uv condition. the ocs may allow new instructions to be configured during parde events to allow changes to pre - defined operational parde mission plans sent from the ocs. a parde mission plan may include multiple waypoints or destinations along which a uv may experience difficulties, which makes necessary the ability for the uv to receive real - time instructions given to facilitate an efficient and effective management of system conditions such as battery level and heat. to ensure compliance with operation parde mission plans, the ocs may continuously monitor the uvs current pose, speed, and acceleration. fig1 depicts and exemplary parde system including a plurality uvs 102 controlled from a plurality of varcs 101 by remote drone pilots and remote drone co - pilots rdcps 106. an operational control system 103 communicates with both the uvs 102 and the varcs 101 via a wireless connectivity option 107. co - located varc and uv deployment options are represented by 105. the uvs 102 may be air, ground, surface water, or underwater based uv types. each uv type operating within a parde event does so within parde configuration settings which include data and settings such as rdp and rdcp control sensitivity and configuration preferences, all visual, audio, motion and tactile augmented content information, the parde universal geo - fence and each uv & # 39 ; s personal geo - fence. each uvs 102 on - board processing system and the ocs 103 monitor and manage the speed, acceleration, and directional characteristics of each uv within the active parde environment and ensure uv speed, acceleration and directional characteristics and controls remain within parde configuration settings and make autonomous adjustments based on calculated parde configuration setting violations due to rdp or rdcp 106 manual inputs from their varc 101 or other environmental and system factors that cause potential violations. the main components of each uv include a receiver, an on - board processing system, a global positioning system, one or more sensors, a transmitter, an on - board motion system, and an on - board payload and support system. the uvs 102 on - board processing system in combination with the ocs 103 monitor, manage and transmit augmented audio and video content to the varcs 101, which are being operated by rdps and rdcps 106. one or more varcs 101 may be bound to a single uv 102. a single rdp 106 controls the motion and directional control systems of a single uv 102 via their varc 101. multiple rdcps 106 may be bound to a single uv 102 and may control one or more on - board payload and support systems and provide sensor monitoring management. the varc 101 provides an augmented reality visual, audio and tactile experience tailored to the rdp or the rdcp 106 controlling the system. the varc 101, in a basic embodiment may be virtual reality goggles for first person view from the uv 102 and handheld uv remote controls. a full deployment of the varc 101 immerses individual users into a sound and light proof environment where the rdp and rdcps 106 experience the parde. the varc 101 in this embodiment enables the user to remotely control their uv 102 while providing a real - time visual and tactile ( 6 degrees of motion ) experience of what the uv 102 they are piloting is seeing and how it is physically oriented and reacting to the environment around it. additionally, the varc system provides user communication options to a control pilot 104 and other users participating in the parde. the varc display includes heads - up - display and receives video and audio content from the ocs 103 and on - board processing systems that with which the rdp and rdcps 106 can interact. hud content may include a variety of information that has been pre - configured via the parde configuration settings, such as land - mark indications and information, flight routes, and may include active gaming information on current game activity, user score, or additional information on rdps and rdcps 106 participating in the parde. varcs 101 include visual, audio, control, tactile and motion feedback along with processing and transmission systems. at a minimum, all varc 101 embodiments include some form of visual, control, processing and transmission systems. the ocs 103 is controlled and operated by a single ( or multiple working in coordination with each other ) control pilot 104. the ocs 103 enables the cp 104 to pre - configure the parde configuration settings, monitor all rdp and rdcps 106 and associated uvs 102 operating within the mission. the cp 104 can take direct or autonomous over - ride control of any parde active uv 102 and has the ability to modify any parde configuration settings. the cp 104 also communicates with local officials and with any one, multiple, or all rdps 106 within the parde. the ocs 103 receives and augments data from the uvs 102 and passes it to users 106 within the varcs 101. the ocs 103 also receives user 106 commands and determines whether they violate any mission safety parameters, only passing through approved commands to the vehicles 102. additionally, the ocs 103 generates pre - configured augmented audio and video content and delivers that information to varc users 106 to enhance the user & # 39 ; s parde environment and / or, increase probability of the user 106 successfully completing the parde objectives. the ocs 103 allows for configuration of all parde configuration settings including, but not limited to : configuration of mission spatial environment through three dimensional geo - coordinates, user accessible augmented audio and visual content tagged to geo - coordinates within a defined space, defined fail - safe return home position within the defined space, number and types of uvs 102 to be controlled within the environment, varc 101 to uv 102 pairing, varc 101 control system configuration ( i. e, pilot or payload system control ), varc 101 control system configuration for pilot experience level and preferences, varc 101 tactile motion level preference, communication with one or more pilots operating in the environment communication systems with faa, regulators, and local officials for pre, during, and post flight communication and includes the ability to visually monitor all pilots 106 operating within their varcs 101, view each operating uv camera view, shut down varc control and pilot 106 varc experience, take over - ride control of one or more uvs through direct operator 104 control or by pre - defined or new geo - coordinate way points to direct the uv 102 to complete a task. connectivity between the ocs 103 and varcs 101 may be wired or wireless and connectivity 107 between ocs 103 and uvs 102 will be wireless. connectivity protocols from the ocs 103 include sufficient bandwidth to ensure undiscernible lag of uv video feeds or delivery of augmented video and audio content from the ocs to the varcs. based on the connectivity flexibility with the ocs 103 the varc deployment 105 may be central to the uv parde launch site or may be remote and limitless on the distance with the appropriate connectivity and bandwidth availability. as noted above, the ocs may over - ride varc command if safety considerations are violated, if universal geo - fence parameters are violated and if personal geo - fence parameters are violated. there are several variables capable of activating the over - ride if they go above or below a chosen threshold ( e. g., safety considerations, geofence violations ). examples of such variables are velocity, altitude, proximity, global position etc. exemplary pseudo - code is given below for how two uvs 102 detecting a violation of the universal geofence 1501 and personal geofences 1502 and implement override commands. the illustrative pseudo - code is for a simple box - shaped geofence : include corn putereturncommandfunction include collisionavoidfunction ; float x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2. xmin ( 0 ), xmax ( 100 ), ymin ( 0 ), ymax ( 200 ), zmin ( 20 ), zmax ( 100 ), vechilemindist ( 2 ). the includes ( compute and collision ) above tells the code where the functions it will need to run are defined. for example, if the uv 102 has gone beyond xmax or ymax ( universalgeofence ), a command in the negative x or y direction would be generated by the computereturncommandfunction. note that if none of the if statements apply, the command passed is simple varccommand, or the rdps command. the collision avoidance, or personal geofence ) is achieved much the same way, proximity in x or y is detected, and appropriate function called to generated override command. fig2 is a flow chart of an exemplary architecture for use with the embodiment depicted in fig1. fig2 shows an example architecture for the example parde system in accordance to the embodiments of the invention. fig2 shows the three main parde system architectural components including the uv 102, with the varcs 101, and the ocs 103 and includes associated sub - components and interconnectivity and relationships between components. the uvs 102 include a receiver 205, autopilot 211, onboard processor 212, global position system 206, sensors 207, transmitters 208, and onboard motion, payload and support systems 213. the ocs 103 includes one or more ocs -

mechanical machines able to transport and move in three dimensional space with control, propulsion and payload systems as described below. as shown in fig3, primary systems in each uv 102 include receiver ( s ) 205, a global positioning system ( gps ) 206, sensors 207, transmitters and data link systems 208, an onboard processing system ( ops ) 210 and onboard motion, payload and support systems ( ompss ) 213. primary onboard motion, payload and support systems include structural and landing systems 409 and propulsion and steering systems 410. secondary systems include parde dependent and specific onboard payload and support systems ( opss ) 408. onboard motion systems 407 are the combination of structural and landing systems 409 and propulsion and steering systems 410. uv 102 movement can be initiated by creating forces leading to movement. propulsion systems can have a source of mechanical power ( some type of engine or motor, muscles ), and some means of using this power to generate force, such as wheel and axles, propellers, a propulsive nozzle, wings, fins or legs. structural components can be metal, plastic or composite materials. landing system components can be vertical take off and landing ( vtol ) components, runway driven, low - impact parachute and / or balloon, airbags or cushions. components should be made of weatherproof and durable material and constructed and assembled to withstand environmental factors. propulsion and steering systems 410 include commercial available components such as electronic speed control ( esc ) motors. wireless receivers 205 can be infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices ; professional land mobile radio ( lmr ), professional specialized mobile radio ( smr ) ; consumer two way radio including family radio service, general mobile radio service ( gmrs ) and citizen & # 39 ; s band ( cb ) radios ; amateur radio ( ham radio ) ; consumer and professional marine vhf radios ; air - band and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control ; cellular telephone ; wireless usb or bluetooth ; satellite, and / or wi - fi. most embodiments have a gps 206 that records and transmits the latitude and longitude of the uv 102 with an accuracy of less than one meter. the latitude and longitude of the gps unit is typically determined by receiving gps satellite broadcast signals ( carrier frequency with modulation ) that includes a pseudorandom code ( sequence of ones and zeros ) that is known to the receiver. by time - aligning a receiver - generated version and the receiver - measured version of the code, the time of arrival ( toa ) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale. the message that includes the time of transmission ( tot ) of the code epoch ( in gps system time scale ) and the satellite position at that time is also received by the receiver. the receiver measures the toas ( according to its own clock ) of four or more satellite signals. from the toas and the tots, the receiver forms four time of flight ( tof ) values, which are ( given the speed of light ) approximately equivalent to receiver - satellite range differences. the receiver then computes its three - dimensional position and clock deviation from the four tofs. the receiver position ( in three dimensional cartesian coordinates with origin at the earth & # 39 ; s center ) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to gps system time are computed simultaneously, using the navigation equations to process the tofs. the receiver & # 39 ; s earth - centered solution location is usually converted to latitude and longitude relative to an ellipsoidal earth model. these coordinates may be displayed ( e. g. on a moving map display ) and / or recorded and / or used by other systems ( e. g., vehicle guidance ). onboard sensors 207 are for flight or vehicle management and control capturing audio and visual signals from the uv location and field of view for transmission to the ocs control and monitoring systems 218. for pardes that require a high level of precision with respect to uv locations, sensors may include the following to augment gps 206 data : laser sensors 401, optical sensors ( including infrared ( ir ) ) 402, altimeters and / or acoustic depth finders 404. laser sensors 401 field measure in real time uv height and distances from site obstacles and features. as described in more detail later, optical sensors capture real time images of the parde location making sure to specifically locate in their field of view pre - located qr ( quick response ) codes ( or site specific landmarks ) for geo - referencing. there may be separate optical sensors for navigation assistance and for payload support systems. additional onboard sensors 207 include gyroscope ( s ) 403 for flight control, unexpected obstacle avoidance 405 and critical systems 406 for monitoring battery power and emergency maneuvers and notification. lidar ( light detection and ranging ) system sensors 414 can be used to real - time mapping, sonar sensors 415 and pressure sensors 413 may also be used to relay information back to the ocs 103 and rdp or cp. transmitters and data link systems 208 may include a radio controlled transmitter, wi - fi, or satellite wireless systems. a radio transmitter connected to an antenna producing an electromagnetic signal such as in radio and television broadcasting, two way communications or radar. transmitters must meet use requirements including the frequency of operation, the type of modulation, the stability and purity of the resulting signal, the efficiency of power use, and the power level required to meet the system design objectives. transmitters generate a carrier signal which is normally sinusoidal, optionally one or more frequency multiplication stages, a modulator, a power amplifier, and a filter and matching network to connect to an antenna. a very simple transmitter might contain only a continuously running oscillator coupled to some antenna system. more elaborate transmitters allow better control over the modulation of the emitted signal and improve the stability of the transmitted frequency. for transmitter and data link systems 208 relying on wi - fi, the uv has to be equipped with a wireless network interface controller. the combination of computer and interface controller is called a station. all stations share a single radio frequency communication channel. transmissions on this channel are received by all stations within range. the hardware does not signal the user that the transmission was delivered and is therefore called a best - effort delivery mechanism. a carrier wave is used to transmit the data in packets, referred to as ethernet frames. each station is constantly tuned in on the radio frequency communication channel to pick up available transmissions. wi - fi technology may be used to provide internet access to devices that are within the range of a wireless network that is connected to the internet. the coverage of one or more interconnected access points ( hotspots ) can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square miles. coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. electronic signal repeaters may be needed to extend the wireless signal to the entire parde local. onboard processing systems ( ops ) 210 include autopilot hardware and software 211 and an onboard processor ( op ) 212. autopilot hardware and software can be open - source autopilot systems oriented toward inexpensive autonomous aircraft. an autopilot allows a remotely piloted aircraft to be flown out of sight. all hardware and software can be open - source and freely available to anyone under licensing or applicable agreements. free software autopilots provide more flexible hardware and software. autopilot hardware and software 211 is modified as described below to include special flight control requirements. an onboard processor 212 is a computer processing unit and uninterruptable power supply ( ups ) onboard individual uvs 102. one function of the onboard processor is to process and compress video signals from optical sensors 402 prior to transmission to the ocs - cpu node # n 203, processing of gps 206 data and optical sensor 402 data for determining uv 102 location ( s ), and return home fail - safe flight control in the event of loss of signal from the ocs 103. fig4 illustrates exemplary architecture for an unmanned vehicle for use with embodiments disclosed herein. integral to the architecture is modularity and adaptability to vehicles regardless of their classification ( i. e., uav 301, ugv 302, usv 303 or uuv 304 ). while components such as onboard processing systems 210 and onboard motion, payload and support systems 213 are adapted and designed for compatibility and functionality for the various vehicle classifications, several components including gps 206, sensors 207, receivers 205 and transmitters 208 have less need for specialization. on board payload and support systems ( opss ) 408 can include items such high - resolution cameras, ir and thermography imaging systems or other sensory systems. systems to include various camera types with different focal lengths and sensor sizes ( rgb, multi - spectral camera ), gaming accessories ( e. g., ir beam for targeting, optical sensor / receiver for measuring hits ). as shown in fig4, the uvs are provided approved remote drone pilot ( rdp ) commands or override commands 209 from the ocs 103. as previously discussed, rdps and rdcps commands are processed and assessed for consistency with the parde mission plan, safety requirements, etc. prior to being transmitted to the uvs 102. override commands to the uv are implemented at the discretion of the control pilot 104 and parde specific flight rules. data from onboard sensors will be transmitted to the ocs 103 and onboard processor 212. sensors have flight control and monitoring duties and may be used as the primary flight guidance tools in the event contact to the ocs 103 is lost and / or the gps 206 signal is unavailable. loss of signal and resulting control architecture is presented in more detail in fig1 a, 16 b and 16 c. basic functionality of the uv 102 is presented in table 1. fig6 presents an exemplary virtual augmented reality cockpit ( varc ) # n 101 in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein. components of the varc can include : varc -

cpu node # n 203. ar content can be delivered at specific planer markers or gps 206 waypoints. content will be associated to planer markers or gps waypoints and presented visually through the varc 101 to the user when associated marker or waypoint is within the user & # 39 ; s field of view. ar will be superimposed in the real - world view at pre - defined coordinates, at appropriate corresponding gps coordinates, at qr codes or at known vector locations within the real - world view. ar content may be directly visible to the rdp or rdcp 106 or cp 104 or accessible to the users through a visual interactive interface. content can be adjusted in size and proportion in order to look near or far based on distance of uv to marker or waypoint and based on configured size of augmented content within the real world. visual interactive interfaces may also adjust size and proportion based on distance and rdps will interact through voice, mechanical, motion, or other means. augmented content data and settings 216 include, but are not limited to, the following : content category identification ( id ) and information 816, tactile profile 817 data, olfactory and sensory profile 818 data, animation databases 819, multimedia partner feeds 820, site specific augmented reality content 821, storyboards 822 and production elements 823. content category id and information 816 is used to categorize and easily retrieve parde ar content from one parde to another. tactile profile 817 data includes the protocols for delivering a motion feedback pattern to the varc 101 and rdp and / or rdcp 106. for example, a ugv 302 might feel differently to a user if it were moving over sand and rocks as opposed to asphalt. that tactile difference will be programmed to the varc 101 through the ocs 103 using these settings. similarly, olfactory and sensory profile 818 data will include initiating different particular scents perhaps when the uv is passing through a flower patch or pine forest. a usv 303 might participate in a parde that travels near a waterfall at which time these settings would initiate a water mist to the user for example. animation databases 819 include all the necessary software development to provide animation layered over the fpv of the rdp / rdcp 106 or cp 104. animation will included polygon structures and skins programmed to move, react, and interact with the real environment via the varc 101 and ocs 103. augmented reality visual content and animation can be achieved through proprietary software or open source object recognition library software such as aruco, for opencv. predetermined gps coordinates, qr visual aids within a parde will be used as anchor points to tie the visual ar content to real environment locations. data from optical sensors 402 will be sent to the ocs - cpu node # n 203 where object recognition software will be run. distinct and unique non - planar markers will be used for positioning reference, though may be possible to use gps waypoints as substitutes depending on type of content and needed location accuracy needed. augmented content can be pushed to or retrieved by the user. the goal is to render ar content to the user at between 27 to 30 frames per second ( fps ). augmented content preferences can be configured. multimedia partner feeds 820 from 3 rd party producers such as book, radio and television or internet based publishers ( e. g., national geographic, or the history channel ), will provide content for delivery to the varcs 102 and users. site specific ar content 821 could be 2d or 3d graphics, video, text or audio content the parde location and event needs. multi - model, multiuser pardes may be choreographed and planned from beginning to end. as such, storyboards 822 and associated production elements 823 ( lighting, music, and staging ) will be developed and used for re - occurring parde themes and topics. augmented visual content development and delivery 1001 shown in fig1 have pre - programmed display 1002 features, real time display 1003 features prompted, or initiated by triggers 1004 ( e. g., specific gps coordinate ), and site specific display requirements 1005. there are common elements between the pre -

related requirements. information specific to a defined real - world location ( such as landmark information or topology information ) will be presented at the gps coordinates of that real - world location. telemetry associated to other uvs 102 operating within the current parde will be displayed in association with that uvs location as it is visible in the real - world view. augmented audio content development and delivery 1101 shown in fig1 have pre - programmed audio 1102 features, real time audio 1103 features prompted and site specific audio requirements 1104. there are common elements between the pre - programmed audio 1102 and real time audio 1103 to the varc 101 through the ocs. they include but are not limited to : audio files, gps coordinates, 3 rd party content and services site specific audio requirements 1104 might be age restricted material, local audio files, or advertising and business - related requirements. information specific to a defined real - world location ( such as landmark information or topology information ) will be presented at the gps coordinates of that real - world location. telemetry associated to other uvs 102 operating within the current parde will be transmitted in association with that uvs as it is located the real - world view. augmented tactile and motion content development and delivery 1201 shown in fig1 have pre - programmed motion and tactile features 1202, real time motion and tactile response 1203 and site specific motion and tactile requirements 1204. there are common elements between the pre - programmed motion and tactile features 1202 and real time motion and tactile response 1203 to the varc 101 through the ocs. they include but are not limited to : motion signatures and profiles, olfactory profiles, moisture profiles, heat and air profiles, and gps coordinates. real - time motion and tactile response 1203 also includes protocols for setting responses to the uv & # 39 ; s 102 proximity to the universal geofence or its proximity to other uvs. site specific motion and tactile requirements 1204 might be age restricted motion, motion signatures profile settings, and advertising and business - related requirements. motion and tactile feedback specific to a defined real - world location ( e. g., cold, moist tunnel ) will be presented at the gps coordinates of that real - world location. telemetry associated to other uvs 102 operating within the current parde will be processed and may impact the varc 101 motion and / or tactile feedback if another uv enters the personal geofence boundary as discussed later. a hierarchic object - oriented design diagram of the environmental interface, payload control and gaming systems is shown in fig1. augmented environmental interface and gaming content development and delivery 1301 have pre - programmed payload requirements 1302, real time payload 1303 requirements and site specific payload requirements 1304. there are common elements between the pre - programmed payload requirements 1302 and real time payload 1303 requirements to the varc 101 through the ocs. they include but are not limited to chemical, physical and electrical manipulation profiles, and gps coordinates. real - time payload 1303 features also includes protocols for setting responses to the uv & # 39 ; s 102 proximity to the universal geofence or its proximity to other uvs. site specific payload requirements 1304 might be vibration restrictions, weather conditions, chemical, physical and electrical manipulation profile settings, and advertising and business - related requirements. payload response specific to a defined real - world location ( e. g., environmental parameter measuring instrument such as a photoionization detector ) will be presented at the gps coordinates of that real - world location. telemetry associated to other uvs 102 operating within the current parde will be processed and may impact the varc 101 payload controls feedback. fig1 shows a generalized personalized augmented reality drone event ( parde ) run flowchart. 1404 shows a conceptual representation of the variable control a rdp 106 may be allowed to have by the ocs 103 and cp 104 based upon the pilot & # 39 ; s past performance and results of user skill level protocol assessment 1403. the assessment can occur at any time before the parde is started. in - parde modifications can be made to the level of control a pilot is given by the cp 104. an expert in 1404 may be give full attitude control while a less experience rdp, or beginner will only be give a perceived 1 - st order control. this would be analogous to riding a roller coaster on rails and have the speed controlled by either the ocs 103 or cp 104. the safety and content override command 1412 are flight control related and ar elements of the approved remote drone pilot ( rdp ) command or override command 209. controls and ar content are continually reviewed, assessed, processed and transmitted by the ocs 103 and / or cp 104. as the level of sophistication and programmable protocols are automated in the ocs 103, less direct control and / or supervision by the cp 104 will be needed. fig1 shows an example parde universal and personal geofencing in accordance with the invention. the parde universal geofence layout 1501 is developed by defined boundary locations of a 3d space. the parde personal geofence 1502 is defined as a sphere of radius x whereby autonomous behavior of the uvs 102 are initiated to avoid collisions for example. the universal boundaries are defined using universal geofence settings 1503 in cartesian coordinates ( latitude, longitude and elevation ). the accuracy of the grid is less than 1 foot depending on the gps 206 and parde spatial data 801 and point cloud resolution. the location of universal geofence settings 1503 will be such that a 3d space with contiguous sides can be rendered providing the uvs with an allowable space to execute the desired parde mission plan. the allowable space will be the 3d universal geofence setting boundaries minus some distance, or buffer zone. fig1 shows a typical universal geofence logic flowchart. autonomous corrective behavior of the uv 102 will be initiated to prevent passing through the geofence boundaries. uv 102 on - board gps 206 optimally provides uv 102 localization ; in cases of gps 206 signal loss the onboard processor 212 redundantly provides vehicle localization based on visual processing algorithms. field located visual quick response ( qr ) codes or equivalent 1504 will be placed in areas of the parde visible by the uvs 102. equivalent visible markers will include some benchmarks and significant locating features 804. this system of qr codes, markers and benchmarks is used to create an outdoor distributed image network ( odin ). the odin defines network of images which allows high accuracy localization which is important for motion control and stable transmission and delivery of ar. uv 102 on - board gps 206 optimally provides vehicle localization ; in cases of gps signal loss the onboard processor 212 redundantly provides vehicle localization based on visual processing algorithms. in case of command signal loss the autopilot will return the vehicle to its origin point, if gps signal is also lost it will do the same based off the onboard processor visual processing. fig1 a, 17 b and 17 c are visual representations of the safety protocols of this claim for various loss of signal scenarios. gps 206, sensors 207, receiver 205 and the onboard processing systems ( ops ) 210 function redundantly to allow for a high degree of certainty with respect to uv 102 location. loss of signal 1601 can occur from these systems. when the gps 206 signal is lost, sensor 207 visual cues can be used with processing by the ocs 103 for safe return to an approved home base, landing or staging area for example. if the loss of signal 1701 is to the receiver 205, gps 206 and visual cues 1702 together are processed in the ops 210 to direct a safe return of the uv 102 for example. if the loss of signal is to both the receiver 205 and gps 206 system, visual cues 1702 from the sensor 207 could be processed in the ops 210 to direct a safe return of the uv 102 for example. the personal geofence is a defined 3d sphere around individual uvs which is not allowed to overlap with another uvs individual geofence. any command by a rdp ( s ) to bring uvs close enough to violate this rule will result in the ocs 103 overriding their commands and separating the vehicles to an acceptable distance. uv 1 and uv # m in the figure show the closest proximity two uvs may be allowed before override command 209 prevents a collision. fig1 a and 18b show examples of conceptual pardes for example gaming and eco - touring pardes. both are showing events in to occur in real time in real environments ( e. g., school football field, forest and ocean ). multi - model uvs include aerial, ground and underwater vehicles. both universal geofences 1501 and personal geofences 1502 are shown. elements of the odin field located qr codes 1504 and universal geofence settings 1503 are shown. site specific augmented content 821 represented by two ar animated castles is visible through the varc 101. an example 3d point cloud from topographic mapping 805 and vegetative mapping 806 are shown.","architecture for a multimodal , multiplatform switching , unmanned vehicle swarm system which can execute missions in diverse environments . the architecture includes onboard and ground processors to handle and integrate multiple sensor inputs generating a unique uv pilot experience for a remote drone pilot via a virtual augmented reality cockpit . the rdp is monitored by an operational control system and an experienced control pilot . a ground processor handles real -

"in the following, the present invention will be described using different exemplary embodiments. since in the present invention route recommendations are given as a function of risks, some more detailed considerations regarding different risk types are to be made first ( see also fig4 ). in one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, risks are divided into static and dynamic risks, it being possible to further subdivide dynamic risks into weak - dynamic and high - dynamic. static risks may occur permanently, may occur as a result of a time - variation curve, and / or may occur as a result of season. a permanent risk may be assumed for specific urban areas ( for example, the bronx, n. y. ) or for specific routes. a static permanent risk of a route may be assumed, for example, if the route is confusing, passes through a tunnel or an underpass, is steep, deserted, or slippery. for this purpose, in one additional exemplary embodiment it is provided that a user may evaluate or weight the individual risks in his system control, ideally in advance. this may lead to an older person completely avoiding steep routes, for example, while a younger person sets the risk to only 10 %. analogously, evaluations for underpasses may have differing strengths for women and men. at the same time, while individual conditions present a risk for all users equally ( possibly having different weights ), for example, an urban area such as the bronx, n. y. would present a certain risk for pedestrians, cyclists, inline skaters, and also motorcycle and car drivers at all times ; likewise, specific conditions of the route, such as grade crossings, also present a risk for all users at all times and should thus be categorized as a permanent risk. other permanent risks are relevant only for individual users, such as motorists or pedestrians / cyclists. for example, routes having numerous turning maneuvers or lane changes for vehicles 03 could be evaluated as having an increased risk. in contrast, routes having existing bike paths would be preferable for cyclists, that is, should be evaluated as having a lower risk than routes without bike paths. for cyclists and pedestrians, for example, the evaluation of route conditions such as confusing, steep, deserted, or slippery routes would be valuable, whether the route has underpasses, or whether many crossings without traffic lights are necessary or wide roads without crosswalks have to be crossed in a route. specific regions or specific routes, for example, city centers or arterial roads, during rush hour, or roads, parks, and places at night, should be evaluated as having a varyingly high risk resulting from a time - variation curve. here too, as a rule the estimation of the risk for vehicles 03 would have to be evaluated differently than that for pedestrians or cyclists. for vehicles 03, areas or routes should be evaluated as having a higher risk during rush hour, while the criterion street, park, or place at night is significant for pedestrians and cyclists. for example, passes in winter are static, seasonally driven risks for all road users. additionally, static seasonally driven and time - variation - curve - driven risks may be taken into account in the route calculation ; this includes, for example, deer crossings during mating season at twilight, which are taken into account in particular for the route calculation for vehicles 03 in one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. in another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, static quasi - permanent risks are taken into account in the route calculation or route evaluation as a further subgroup of the static risks. this includes, for example, construction sites with corresponding lane constrictions, which are to be categorized as a risk for all road users. in one further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a weak - dynamic risk group is provided. the weather would be one such weak - dynamic risk, which is included, and possibly weighted differently, in the route calculation for all road users so that during a thaw paths having many curves, poor paving, a high altitude above sea level, gravel roads, or the like are evaluated as having a correspondingly higher risk in the corresponding weather conditions. other weak - dynamic risks are, for example, specific driving behavior, short - term construction sites, or demonstrations, rallies, or sporting events, which are accordingly weighted, for example, with regard to a danger when turning left, when changing lanes, when driving in the city or in snow ( specific driving behavior ), in the event of lane constrictions ( short - term construction site ), or in the presence of hooligans ( demonstrations, rallies, or sporting events ). a further important risk group for the evaluation of the routes is high - dynamic risks, which result in particular from the current driving situation of vehicles 03. in this context, information regarding the surroundings of vehicle 03, the velocity of vehicle 03, and / or possible alternative routes are taken into account. in this context, the information regarding the surroundings of vehicle 03 is ascertained by sensor systems such as radar sensors, video sensors, car2car sensors, car2infrastructure sensors, or the like. these parameters are then taken into account in the evaluation of driving maneuvers for the provided travel route, such as necessary lane change or turning maneuvers. in one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, static and possibly weak - dynamic influences are taken into account already in the preliminary stages in the route calculation ; high - dynamic influences are included in the calculation at short notice. driving recommendations may be output in various ways as a function of the risk type : for example, in the event of static risks, instructions for the optimal route could be given early in order to avoid distracting the driver with instructions in high - risk situations ; in the event of high - dynamic influences, suboptimal instructions could be given in high - risk situations in order to avoid risky driving maneuvers. in low - risk situations, it could be provided that a plurality of alternative instructions are given, the sequence of the alternative instructions and / or supplementary information for the alternative instructions indicating to the user of the navigation system the advantages and disadvantages associated with the respective routes. because the pedestrian has time to concern himself with the route guidance, another exemplary embodiment provides outputting additional information about which risks lie on which routes, so that the user himself may decide which way is the most favorable for him. in one possible embodiment, the present invention may be executed as an upgrade to a traditional vehicle navigation system 01. in such an exemplary embodiment, vehicle navigation system 01 has a connection to external sensors 02, such as radar sensors, video sensors, car2car sensors, and / or car2infrastructure sensors, for example, via a bus system or an air interface. these sensors 02 provide information about the current traffic situation in the surroundings of vehicle 03. with the help of this information, vehicle navigation system 01 may evaluate the risk of performing a driving maneuver that is optimal in terms of time and distance, that is, a maneuver that follows the shortest, quickest, or optimal route. to this end, in one exemplary embodiment, navigation system 01 includes means 04 for evaluating the risk in following the optimal driving instruction and means 05 for determining driving instructions that are optimal in terms of safety, taking into account a possible detour. in one exemplary embodiment, means 05 for determining driving instructions that are optimal in terms of safety weights the risk relative to a possible detour or time loss. if this risk is small, for example, straight - ahead driving or turning on a one - lane road, the optimal driving instruction is output. however, if the risk is relatively high, for example, when turning on a street having multiple driving lanes 06, whereby lane - changes would be necessary in dense traffic, under certain circumstances the suboptimal driving instruction is output. fig2 shows such a situation. currently, vehicle 03 is located in the outermost left lane. according to the optimal travel route, the driver would actually have to turn right and to this end would have to change lanes twice in dense traffic, however. for this reason, here a straight would be recommended, as long as the resulting detour is not too long. the optimal driving instruction is given earlier than usual so that the driver has more time to situate himself correctly and to execute the driving maneuver safely and in a stress - free manner. one possible development stage of this system provides informing the driver explicitly that following this optimal driving instruction is important since otherwise a detour of x km would automatically result along with the corresponding time loss, for example, because no other expressway exit exists within the next 20 km. a suboptimal driving instruction is given, for example, a recommendation is made to the driver to continue driving straight, but to keep right, even though he actually should have exited the expressway. the detour resulting thereby should, however, have a reasonable relationship to the risk that following the optimal driving instruction would have meant. in this case, the driver possibly does not even notice that he actually should have left the expressway and arrives at the destination in a manner that is more stress - free, since he does not attempt to follow the driving instruction at all costs. at the next exit, he is then prompted to exit. a plurality of alternative driving instructions is given, for example, a recommendation is given to the driver to drive straight or to turn right. in this context, the sequence of the instructions could make it possible to distinguish between optimal and suboptimal instruction. in an additional development stage, distances and / or times for the alternatives could possibly be output as well. a further variant provides in particular when a car2car sensor is present that host vehicle 03 coordinates its intention to turn with other road users 07, in order to be able to then cooperatively and uncritically travel the optimal path. in an alternative embodiment, it is provided that a route is calculated for all possible exit paths of an intersection and the driver is provided with time and distance information for these alternatives. in order to clearly inform the driver about the alternative travel routes, vehicle navigation system 01 is equipped with means 08 for outputting driving instructions that are optimal in terms of safety, for example, a human - machine interface ( hmi ). advantageously, means 08 for outputting driving instructions that are optimal in terms of safety are provided with possibilities for the acoustic and also visual output of the driving instructions. for the optical output, a color identification of the different paths may be provided ( see fig3 ) ( dark paths are to be preferred, for example, light ones are worse, depending on the gray - scale value, the driver then sees at a glance which possibilities are really worth discussing ). alternatively, one could also work with colors, thickness of dashes, solid or dotted display, etc. acoustically, one could analogously work with volume or sequence of the instruction. however, the previously described turn - by - turn displays may be transferred analogously to 2d or 3d displays, that is, it is possible to use a display in any scale of the 2 or 3 dimensional map. in certain situations, this has the advantage that the driver obtains a larger overview of the varied highway routing. ( for example, 3d displays of the pictograms with the route, or in the video image / photo. ) in addition to corresponding sensor system 02, knowing, for example, the number of lanes 06 and the turning possibilities on individual lanes 06 is important in all of these scenarios, which means that when the method according to the present invention is executed, relevant map material is accessed. the points listed above for vehicle navigation systems 01 are also essentially valid for navigation systems that are used by pedestrians, cyclists, inline skaters, other recreational athletes or other users who move at a lower speed. such navigation systems are then as a rule installed on mobile terminals, such as personal digital assistants ( pda ), for example, electronic travel guides, or mobile phones. on the other hand, in the different embodiments, it is advantageous to take into account some special risk types that occur in this group and that are described in more detail above ( see also fig4 ). the present invention is not limited in its embodiment to the preferred exemplary embodiment stated above. rather, a number of variants could conceivably make use of the system and the method according to the present invention even for basically different types of embodiments.","the invention relates to a route guidance method and a system for implementing such a method , and a corresponding computer - readable storage medium , which in particular may be used for an adaptive route guidance , the travel routes being selected that offer the highest safety when following the required driving maneuvers . for this purpose , it is recommended to output driving recommendations as a function of the risk of calculated routes . to this end , information about the current traffic situation in the surroundings of the vehicle is evaluated , the risk of the driving maneuvers resulting from calculated routes is evaluated using the results of the evaluation by at least one computer program , and driving instructions are output as a function of the evaluation ."
"in its simplest embodiment, the present invention comprises a series of wires held at high voltage in a flowing stream of air generated by a fan - like device and a collection means of the assay device exposed to the stream, and having an electrode juxtaposed so as to attract charged particles from the flowing stream. the juxtaposed electrode creates a potential well that will cause the charged particles to be electrostatically precipitated on a collection area of the assay device. thus, fig3 illustrates such a device in detail. the device comprises a non - conductive housing 35, an entrance grill 31 and exit grill 37. a pumping device, such as a fan 36, directs and pulls through a flowing airstream entering at 30 and exiting at 38. wire electrodes 32, seen in cross - section in fig3, are held at high voltage, in the range of kilovolts, and plasma generation results in charged particles 33 which are attracted out of the flowing airstream via a potential well on to a capture means 42 of the assay device 43. assay device 43 incorporates an electrode 41 which is shown to be grounded with the common electrical symbol for grounding. the assay device 43 is removably supported and clamped in an indented aperture 39 in the housing 35. for clarity, the assay device 43 is separately illustrated in fig4. thus, to perform an assay, the assay device is clamped in aperture 39 in the housing 35 of the electrokinetic device of the present invention, exposed to a predetermined voltage, flow rate and time, then removed. one form of assay would be a lateral flow immunochromatographic device, in which case the assay is initiated by application of a suitable chromatographic transport facilitating fluid to the sample well 42 and reading the result after a predetermined time. numerous other simple assay systems can also be used, involving optical or electrochemical detection and determination of the presence or absence or amount of the agent to be assayed. since the device of the present invention performs in a dielectric medium, conductive aqueous fluids would normally need to be added to the various assay types to initiate a detection reaction. the understanding of the present invention is facilitated by the illustrations of prior art devices. further, because the present invention can be fabricated by simple modifications of prior art devices, figures including drawings of several prior art devices have been included. fig1 has been derived from various technical specifications of hvac systems for domestic housing. air flow is driven by a fan 16, provide inlet flow 11 and outlet flow 18, entering via a grill 12, a coarse pre - filter 13 and the high voltage wire electrodes, grounded electrodes 15, upon which charged particles are electrostatically precipitated, and exit grill 17. prefilters are not normally required in the function of the present invention. in a further embodiment of the present invention, fig5 shows a device with the flow of the dielectric fluid propelled by electrokinetic means. the device consists of a non - conductive housing 56, and entrance grills and exits grills 52 and 57, respectively, for the inflowing and outflowing dielectric fluid, 51 and 58, respectively. wires 53, seen in cross section in fig5, are maintained at a positive high voltage, and electrokinetic flow is directed by grounded planar electrodes 55 and 59. an aperture exists in the electrode 59, below which is located a collection means and assay device, removably supported in clamps 39 in the housing 56. as in fig4, the collection means incorporates an electrode 41 which is small in dimensions compared with the grounded planar electrodes 59. the electrode 41 in this case is held at a high negative voltage in the kilovolt range. the planar electrodes 55 and 59 cause the charged particles 54 to be first transported with the net fluid flow, but when they reach the potential well created by the negative electrode 41, they are diverted from the stream on to the collection area of the collection means 43. thus, to perform an assay, the assay device is placed in a suitable aperture 39 in the housing 56 of the electrokinetic device of the present invention, exposed to predetermined voltages of the wires 53 and the electrode 41 and predetermined time, then removed. one form of assay would be a lateral flow immunochromatographic device, in which case the assay is initiated by application of a suitable chromatographic transport facilitating fluid to the sample well 42 and reading the result after a predetermined time. numerous other simple assay systems can also be used, involving optical or electrochemical detection and determination of the agent to be assayed. since the device of the present invention performs in a dielectric medium, conductive aqueous fluids would normally need to be added to the various assay types to initiate a detection reaction. in another embodiment of the present invention, an alternative means of sample collection may be used to create a continuous record of the agent to be analyzed. fig6 illustrates such an embodiment. the device of fig6 is comparable to the device of fig5 in all respects except for the omission of the assay device and replacement by a reel - to - reel sample collection means. the reel to reel device supports and moves the sample collection means orthogonally to the net flow of the dielectric fluid. accordingly, the illustration of fig6 represents a section x. . . x through the device of fig5. the reels 61 and 62 rotate in the directions indicated by arrows, transporting the sample collection means, 62, through slots 64 in the housing 56. an electrode 63, mounted in the housing, is held at a negative voltage in the kilovolt range. similarly to fig5, charged particles will be swept out of the flowing stream by the potential well created by electrode 53, and deposited on the sample collection means 62. thus, to perform an assay, the wire electrode 53 and the electrode 63, whose area is small compared with the grounded planar electrodes 59, are set at predetermined voltages and the reel - to - reel transport device moves the sample collection means for a predetermined time. the sample collection device material may include a passive fibrous or membranous material, or an activated material that will capture the sample in place until the time of assay ; or may be a structured material such as micro - pillar type, and may have embedded capture molecules, such as provide ligand - anti - ligand reactions. upon completion of the predetermined time, the take - up reel 61 is removed and subject to hydration prior to assay, in such a way that the captured agent to be analyzed remains positioned on the capture means, either by active or passive immobilization, or by capture via a ligand - anti - ligand interaction. the assay is performed and the disposition of values along the length of the capture means provides a time record of the presence or amount of the agent measured. the continuous record may be colorimetric, in which case the record is a visual display of the presence or amount of the agent as a function of time. the continuous record may also be digital, in which the record can be presented as a graphic representation of the amount or presence of the agent as a function of time. fig2 is reproduced from the publication of custis et al ( 2003 ). the prior art device of fig2 comprises a housing 24, electrokinetically driven air flow entering at 20 and exiting at 25, wire electrodes 21, and planar electrodes 23. conjectural lines of constant voltage ( voltage contours ) are shown as broken circles surrounding the electrodes 21, and conjectural particle movement in the airstream by arrows 22. this illustrates the particles impinging on and being electrostatically precipitated on the planar electrodes, 23, which are removable. samples for analysis are collected by wiping from the planar electrodes with tissue, extraction and application of the extract to an immunoassay, according to the procedure of custis et al. the advantage of the present invention is that such separate wiping and extraction steps are not required. further, while the contour lines of equal voltage in the prior art of custis et al are conjectural, computer simulations are available which facilitate the design of the devices of the current invention without undue experimentation. brown in fig2 of u. s. pat. no. 2, 949, 550 also drew conjectural lines of voltage gradient. the voltage gradient will determine the force and direction experienced by a charged particle. voltage gradients can be rigorously determined by computer simulation, eliminating undue experimentation. the computer simulation of the devices of the present invention are performed with the use of a software package provided by the company field precision llc, po box 13595, albuquerque, n. mex. 87192, u. s. a. this software provided by field precisions llc utilizes finite element analysis based on coulomb & # 39 ; s law and gauss & # 39 ; s law. the work is described in field solutions on computers ( isbn 0 -

dimensional programs, geometer, metamesh, hiphi and phiview. epa / oar / oria / indoor environments division ( mc - 6609j ) epa 402 - f - 08 - 004, may 2008 for further illustration of the use of the computer simulation, and to demonstrate how the present invention differs from the prior art, representations of prior art devices and arrangements are shown in fig7 a, b and c to fig1 a, b and c. for better understanding of the application of the software package, a detailed description of the process is given for fig7 a, b and c. a representation of the ionic breeze configuration ( fig2 ) is created in the mesh program in fig7 a. a bounding box of 4 units 4 units is defined, and within this box are placed two points, 70, which represent the wire electrodes, and three lines, 71, which represent the planar electrodes. the symmetry is defined as planar. this determines that all cross sections are equivalent extending in the third dimension out of the plane. this version of the software performs the computation in two dimensions, thus simplifying the calculations. the mesh program saves the file in a cad format ( suffix. dxf ) and also converts to a script which is recognized by the estat program ( suffix. mou ). the estat then provides for the addition of dimensions ( units = inches ), material properties such as dielectric constants ( 1 forair ), and voltages ( 1000 for wire electrodes, 0 for planar electrodes ). with these parameters, a new file ( suffix. ein ) is created. the mathematical solution of the simulation is then performed on the. ein file, creating a file with the solution ( suffix. eou ). various graphical representations of the solution of the. eou file are then available. fig7 b shows the contour plot output, with contour lines, lines of equal voltage, given a numerical value label according to the voltage. fig7 c shows the surface plot format. here perspective - drawing is used to express the voltage as a height in the third dimension. the surface plot representation is particularly useful as the steepness and direction of the slope in the surface represents voltage gradient and direction. thus, the surface plot represents the force and direction vector to which a charged particle is subject. it is immediately apparent from fig7 c that charged particles generated at the wire electrodes, or pre - existing in the air, will be propelled down the gradient into the three valleys and directed on to the surfaces of the planar electrodes. the various configurations in the remaining fig8 a, b, and c to fig2 a, b and c are all generated in this way. for the establishment of design concepts for the present invention, the effect of the thickness of the planar electrodes is shown in fig8 a, b and c. in fig7 a, b and c the planar electrodes are represented as having zero thickness, whereas in fig8 a, b and c they are represented as plates with a finite thickness of 1 / 20. in all other respects, these two sets of figures are identical. it can be readily seen that altering from an infinitely thin electrode to one that has finite and practical thickness has no impact on the resulting voltage gradients. the family of u. s. pat. nos. 7, 056, 370, 7, 097, 695 and 7, 311, 762 teach the improvement of reduction of thickness of the electrodes over the prior art, u. s. pat. no. 4, 789, 801. however, further reduction of thickness has no benefit for the current invention. for the purposes of the present invention, a somewhat simpler arrangement of electrodes would be advantageous for facilitating the placement of a third electrode creating a potential well for the capture of the assayable agent on to the collection means of the assay device. accordingly, the computer simulations in fig9 a, b and c and 10 a, b and c show the effect of successive reduction in the number of electrodes. fig9 a shows one high voltage wire electrode 90 and two plate electrodes at 0 voltage, 91. the contour plot fig9 b and the surface plot fig9 c show charged particles generated as plasma at the wire electrode 90, or pre - existing in the air, will be propelled down the gradient into the two valleys and directed on to the surfaces of the planar electrodes. similarly, fig1 a shows a design with a single high voltage wire electrode, 100 and a single plate electrode at zero voltage, 101. the physical arrangement of fig1 a corresponds to the original electrokinetic design of brown in u. s. pat. no. 2, 949, 550. the contour plot fig1 b and the surface plot fig1 c show charged particles generated as plasma at the wire electrode 100, or pre - existing in the air, will be propelled down the gradient into the valleys and directed on to the surfaces of the planar electrode. the design of fig1 a is identical with the design of fig8 a except for the addition of two rod electrodes, 112, of 0. 2 inches diameter and disposed upstream of the wire electrodes 110 and the plate electrodes 111. the electrodes 112 are held at 1000 volts, as are the wire electrodes 110. the plots of fig1 b and 11 c show that the steepness of the voltage gradient is compromised by the presence of the rod electrodes 112, and the generation of plasma and electrokinetic propulsion would be reduced, although charges particles would still be directed into the potential valleys adjacent to the planar electrodes 111. it is to be emphasized that no focusing effect, in the sense used in the current invention, is created. it is to be noted that taylor and lee in the u. s. pat. no. 6, 958, 134, teach that the placement of upstream electrodes serves to assist in the control of the flow of ionized particle. nowhere do taylor and lee teach the use of an electrode of small dimensions compared with the planar electrode as a means of creating a potential well to capture charged particles from a flowing fluid stream. fig1 a, b and c shows that the focusing effect taught by taylor and lee is distinct from the focusing as used in the present invention, as will be made clear from the embodiments of the present invention, which follow. one embodiment of the present invention is shown in fig1 a. this consists of two wire electrodes 120, three plate electrodes, 121 and a capture electrode, 123. this is comparable to the prior art device of fig7 a, b and c, but with the addition of capture electrode 123, according to the present invention. electrodes 120 are at 1000 volts, the plates 121 at 0 volts and the capture electrode 123 is at 1000 volts. the contour plot of fig1 b and the surface plot of fig1 c show that electrokinetically driven charged particles generated by the plasma at the wire electrodes 120 will be driven to the potential valleys in the neighborhood of the plate electrodes 121, but these valleys are downward sloping as is clear in the surface plot of fig1 c. consequently, the flow of charged particles will be propelled in the direction of the capture electrode 123, and eventually will be trapped in the potential well created by the capture electrode 123. note that the downward slope of the valleys in the neighborhood of the planar electrodes 121 is less apparent in the contour plot fig1 b than in the surface plot fig1 c. this is because the plot interval is adjusted for clarity by the simulation program. a more preferred embodiment of the current invention i illustrated in fig1 a, b and c. the electrode arrangement is based on the prior art device of fig9 a, b and c, with the following modifications according to the present invention. the electrode 132 is fabricated with a slot 134, and juxtaposed with dimensions comparable to the slot 134 is the capture electrode 133. see also the electrode arrangement of fig5. this arrangement of creating a potential well off - set laterally to the main electrokinetic fluid flow, may, in certain designs according to the present invention, be more convenient for the insertion of a capture means and assay device than directly in the fluid stream. in spite of this off - set arrangement, the contour plot of fig1 b and the surface plot of fig1 c show the flow of charged particles will be propelled in the direction of the capture electrode 133, and eventually will be trapped in the potential well created by the capture electrode 133. for simplicity and ease of understanding, no capture means or assay device was included in fig1 a, b and c. in fig1 a, b and c, a representation of a capture means and / or assay device, 144, is included. this is placed between the slotted plate electrode 142 and the capture electrode 143. a dielectric constant value of 2. 0 for the capture means and / or assay device is input into the computer simulation. reference values for typical dielectric constants may be obtained from handbook of chemistry and physics, crc press, boca raton, fla., 91 st edition, 2010, section 13. the value 2. 0 is that for dry paper. comparing fig1 a, b and c with fig1 a, b and c, the presence of paper as a capture means has no significant impact on the electric field distribution. from the same web site, polystyrene resin has dielectric constant in the range 2. 4 - 2. 6. in order to cover the span of likely materials for capture means and assay devices, a dielectric constant of 3. 0 was applied to the capture means and / or assay device 154 in the computer simulation of fig1 a, b and c. again, no significant perturbation of the electric field distribution results, comparing fig1 a, b and c, 14 a, b and c and 15 a, b and c. these foregoing simulations thus show that there is great freedom in choice and disposition of capture means and assay devices in designs of the present invention. capture means can be placed on both sides of the capture electrode, as illustrated by 164 and 165 in fig1 a. as in the preceding fig1 a, b and c, 14 a, b and c and 15 a, b and c, there is no significant impact on the electric field distribution. a device according to the present invention based on the prior art device of fig1 a, b and c is shown in fig1 a, b and c. this consists of a single wire electrode 170, a single planar electrode 171 and, additionally, a capture electrode 172, situated downstream of the planar electrode 171. this arrangement may be designed to capture charged particles from the fluid flow by concentrating the stream on a center line with the capture electrode centrally placed. further, the device according to the resent invention in fig1 a, b and c shows the additional placing of a capture means, 183, of dielectric constant 2. 0, between the planar electrode 181 and the capture electrode 182. a preferred design according to the present invention is shown in fig1 a, b and c. here three wire electrodes 190, and three planar electrodes 191, are disposed at angles so as to maximize the fluid flow to converge on the capture electrode, 192, thus optimizing the combination of fluid flow and electrokinetically directed flow in to the potential well created by the capture electrode. the foregoing computer simulation package is adequate to describe the prior art devices where all sections are equivalent for planes extending into a third dimension. however, it would be desirable to create devices that focus a charged particle stream in three dimensions, thus providing a true focusing effect. for this purpose, a higher level software package from field precision llc is used. this package rigorously solves the same basic physical equations in three dimensional space by the same method of finite element analysis. the program is executed in three stages. the program geometer has three - dimensional cad features and is used for the creation of the initial design and visualization, for example, by creation of stereographic diagrams. the program metamesh takes the output from geometer and creates the mesh for finite element analysis, and also inputs dimensions and various electrical and physical properties of the components. hiphi solves the equations for the files created by metamesh and phiview performs further optional calculations and provides for a variety of options for representing the output. thus, the device created in geometer is displayed in fig2 a, b c and d. here, the prior art device of fig9 a, b and c is provided with an additional capture electrode according to the present invention. the wire electrode 200 is 10 inches in length, the plate electrodes 201 are 10 10 inch squares and the capture electrode 202 is 0. 5 0. 5 inches. plate electrodes 201 and capture electrode 202 are 0. 1 inch thick. fig2 a is a general stereographic view showing the orientations of the x, y and z axes. fig2 b is a view of the device looking down the x - axis, fig2 c is a view of the device looking down the y - axis and fig2 d is a view of the device looking down the z - axis. the definition of the axes and the orientation of the parts relative to these axes is important for the understanding of fig2 - 23 since these represent successive planes progressing through the device along the three axes. the device according to the current invention in fig2 - 23 is provided with a voltage of 1000 at the wire electrode 200, 0 volts at the plate electrodes 201 and 1000 volts at the capture electrode 202. the phiview program can represent innumerable planes along each of the three axes, but for the purposes of illustration, only those planes which lie at critical junctures in the device are represented here. thus, fig2 a is in the y - z plane at the position x = 4. 95 the position of the plane is indicated on the vertical axis of each figure. the contour lines of constant voltage are at approximately 100 volt intervals. the density of the contours is an indication of the field strength and hence the force applied to charged particles. the arrows are vectors representing field direction in each cell for which there has been a calculation. thus, in fig2 a there is a moderate force field propelling charge particles away from the center line. note that this is only the component of the vector in the y - z plane, and here, as everywhere else, the final direction is the result of vectors in all three dimensions. the successive fig2 b - 21 h then step successively through the entire device. fig2 b cuts through the plane in which the wire electrode 200 lies, and shows very high field strength propagating out from the wire. next, fig2 c - e cut through orthogonally to the planar electrodes at the extremities and at the center. the field intensity is relatively low in this region, being less than 10 volts per inch, as indicated by one or less contour lines. fig2 f falls intermediate between the planar electrodes and shows increasing voltage gradient in the direction of the center of the section. fig2 g shows a section through the capture electrode and shows extremely high voltage gradient forming the potential well. finally, the plane at x = 5 inches shows moderating field strength, but continued direction of vectors to the center line. surprisingly, any charged particles exiting the device will be swept into the center of the y - z plane, and from fig2 a and 23 a, back into the potential well along the x axis. fig2 a - d show successive x - z planes progressing from the origin outward along the y axis. no sections for negative values of y are shown since the device is symmetrical around the origin of the y - axis. a similar consideration holds for fig2 a - f along the z - axis. fig2 a confirms the findings of the two dimensional analysis software package, with the exception that out of the neighborhood of the center line of fig2 a, vectors direct the stream away from the plate electrodes, or downstream. further, every section of fig2 shows the x - y components of the vectors pointing downstream. hence, the electroprecipitation on the plate electrodes will be minimal. fig2 a shows the section including the wire electrode in the x - y plane, and including the capture electrode. in this section, the forces propelling charged particles from the wire electrode into the potential well of the capture electrode are apparent. fig2 b is a section of the x - y plane just proximal to the capture electrode, and then 23 c, 23 d and 23 e proximal to, cutting through and distal to the plate electrode, which is visible in fig2 d. a further embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in stereographic projections in fig2 a, b and c generated in the geometer program. this embodiment is intended to function as a breathalyzer device for breath - borne pathogens such as m. tuberculosis. this can be implemented using a structure similar to fig3 but eliminating the fan 36. instead, the user blows into the entrance grill 31. the entrance grill 31 directs breathed air flow in the enclosure. fig2 a represents a general perspective view of the electrode arrangement, showing all three x, y and z axes. fig2 b is a view looking down the y - axis, fig2 c is a view looking down the x - axis and fig2 d is a view looking down the z - axis. the fig2 shows only the arrangement of the electrodes, and, for ease of understanding, the supporting structures which are made of materials in a range of dielectric constants that do not influence the electric field, are omitted. the device includes 4 wire electrodes for generating plasma and two capture electrodes which may be used for collection means for two different assay types. thus, capture electrode 241 may be used for an optical sensor device utilizing an immunoassay, as described in detail in patent u. s. pat. no. 7, 384, 793, while capture electrode 242 may be used as a capture device for the nucleic acid amplification based system xpert mtb / rif as described in blakemore et al ( 2010 ) in journal of clinical microbiology, volume 48, pages 2495 - 2501, helb et al ( 2010 ) in journal of clinical microbiology, volume 48, pages 229 - 237, and references therein. the performance of this embodiment is processed with metamesh and results generated with hiphi. fig2 a and b represent two views created from phiview. these two views selected from the complete three dimensional analysis are sufficiently representative to demonstrate the performance. fig2 a is a pseudo - 3d contour plot showing the electric field distribution in an x - y plane intersecting the origin of the z - axis. the z - axis is not a physical z - axis but represents the range 0 - 1000 volts. it can be seen from fig2 a, b, c and d that this plane will intersect all four wire electrodes and midway between the two capture electrodes. it thus shows the formation of potential peaks at the wire electrodes for the generation of plasma and a potential well in the neighborhood of the capture electrodes, which will serve to capture and electroprecipitate charged particles. a further contour plot in fig2 b is the voltage distribution in a parallel plane displaced 1 inch out on the physical z - axis. this plane skirts the extremity of the wire electrodes, which are 2 inches in length. here, too, can be seen the potential peaks at the wire electrodes and the residual potential well that is here 0. 5 inches beyond the extremity of the capture electrode. the ability to incorporate two capture electrodes in this case enhances the sensitivity of the assay by providing for two entirely different assay systems for the same analyte. a further improvement is for the electrode 242 to be replaced by a wire mesh of the same dimensions. a wire mesh electrode has the advantage of creating even greater localized voltage gradients in close proximity to the wires, and thus enhance the capture effect. following sample collection, the wire mesh electrode is removed, immersed in 2 ml of the naoh - isopropanol sample treatment reagent, shaken for 5 seconds, incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, shaken again, and transferred to the xpert mtb / rif cartridge and subject to the standard procedure for that assay device. the naoh - isopropanol reagent is provided by cepheid inc, the manufacturer of the xpert mtb / rif assay device. further multiplex capability can be attained by the use of a multiplicity of capture electrodes. while fig2 a, b and c and 25 a, b and c show the disposition of electrodes in the breathalyzer device, further details of mouthpiece, housing, and interface with an assay device are described in the specifications of u. s. pat. no. 7, 384, 793 as well as collection means and assay device commercialized by rapid biosensor systems limited, babraham, cambridge, uk. a tubular or elliptical section housing can be constructed to accommodate the mouthpiece, with entrance diameter optimized to match the dimensions of the wire electrodes and the exit diameter optimized to match the dimensions of the capture electrodes. the breath will then have maximum contact with wire electrodes, and exit flow can be concentrated over the capture electrodes. it is apparent that the software packages provided by field precision llc are useful for achieving optimal designs without undue experimentation. such programs have been under development for several years. p. l. levin et al ( a unified boundary - element finite - element package in ieeetransactions on electrical insulation 1993, volume 28, pages 161 - 167 ) made such a package available. examples of application of such software packages for the design of electrostatic precipitation devices are given by s. vlad ( numerical computation of conducting particle trajectories in plate - type electrostatic separators in ieee transactions on industry applications 2003, volume 39, pages 66 - 71 ) and by a. bendoaoud et al ( experimental study of corona discharge generated in a modified wire - plate electrode configuration for electrostatic process applications in ieee transactions on industry applications 2010, volume 46, pages 666 - 671 ). optimization of the designs of the present invention is not limited to the software packages provided by field precision llc. a key element of the present invention is the provision of a potential well that will act as a trap for charged particles of interest in a flowing fluid stream. it is possible to design innumerable devices within the scope of this invention, and the configuration shown in the illustrations of this document are intended to be exemplary only. it is surprising that creation of a potential well provides a universal and efficient trap for charged particles and provides for seamless transfer on to a measuring or detection device. the sensitivity of the measurement of the detection or detection device is considerably enhanced by the ability to sample large volumes of fluid and to concentrate the charged particles on to a small area of a detection device. because the properties, disposition and dimensions of non - conducting materials do not significantly affect the voltage field distribution, there are unlimited possibilities for the design and fabrication of devices for practical applications, using, for example any of a wide range of plastic or polymeric non - conducting materials. in the devices described in the foregoing, the area of the capture electrode is small compared with other electrodes in the system, thus providing a large voltage gradient. in the examples, typical ratios of areas of capture electrodes are 20 : 1. depending on the construction of the specific device, this ratio may vary in the range 5 : 1 to 1000 : 1 or even greater, limited only by the performance requirements of the specific system. the capture electrode is usually in the form of a rectangular plate, but may also take the form of a metal grid or mesh. in the case of a multiplicity of wire electrodes for generating plasma, these are usually arrayed as parallel wires, but may also be arranged as a rectangular grid, depending on the requirements or constraints of a specific design. the only constraint is that the geometry of the capture electrode may not be such as to create a potential well with gradient so steep as to initiate plasma generation, and generate charged particles that will be launched out of the potential well on the contrary, the wire electrodes must be of dimensions small enough that they will create a potential gradient sufficient to cause the generation of plasma. the wire electrodes advantageously do not exceed 1. 0 mm in diameter and in one embodiment may have a diameter of approximately 0. 1 mm. however, the geometry of the wires may be varied and may also take the form of spikes with pointed tips. in this case, the pointed tip may give rise to a local potential gradient high enough to give rise to the formation of charged plasma. the voltages applied must be sufficiently large to create the conditions for the functioning of the invention, but voltages can be varied to optimize the performance. the voltage values may be positive or negative at either the wire electrodes or the capture electrodes. for functioning, only relative voltages are important, so that any electrode may also be set at ground or low voltage, for example, for safety reasons. for reduction to practice, the devices of the current invention can be fabricated from simple modifications of existing devices. thus, all the specifications for details of hardware, electronic control, aesthetic considerations, dimensions, portability, power supply from ac mains or battery, are all described in detail in the prior art references given in this document, and so need no further elaboration here. further applications to capture of entities to be assayed in dielectric media other than air can be created using the same principles as enunciated throughout this document. the dielectric fluid medium may further include non - conductive liquids, such as oils. oils may be sampled for the presence of contaminants, contaminating organisms or bio - degrading organisms.","electrokinetic devices and methods are described with the purpose of collecting assayable agents from a dielectric fluid medium . electrokinetic flow may be induced by the use of plasma generation at high voltage electrodes and consequent transport of charged particles in an electric voltage gradient . in one embodiment , the agents are directed electrokinetically to the sample collection assay device with no intermediate transfer steps . the agents are directed by creation of an electrokinetic potential well , which will effect their capture on to an assay device . environmental agents such as biowarfare agents , pathogens , allergens or pollutants are collected autonomously on to the assay device , without any human intervention . the dielectric fluid medium , such as air , is sampled by electrokinetic propulsion with no moving parts or optionally , by transporting the dielectric fluid by a fan , pump or by breath . a further embodiment for collection of pathogen samples entails breathing into a tube where the sample is exposed to an electric plasma in the neighborhood of a high voltage electrode or electrodes , further transported by the breath through a potential well created at a sample collection device , where charge particles are electroprecipitated . the dielectric fluid medium may further include non -

"fig1 illustrates a high - level block diagram of one embodiment of a telecommunications system 100 including an advertising / revenue system 102. the advertising / revenue system 102 is adapted to provide increased capabilities and flexibilities in sharing valued information among users 106 of the telecommunications system 100 and telecommunication targets and / or advertisers 110, 112. in certain aspects, the advertising / revenue system 102 is adapted to more efficiently provide users 106 with timely and relevant information. in certain implementations, the advertising / revenue system 102 is adapted to more effectively match telecommunication targets and / or advertisers 110, 112 with users 106 likely to be interested in their services. in one embodiment, the telecommunications system 100 includes one or more carriers 104 that facilitate communication within the system 100. in one embodiment, the carriers 104 comprise landline or wired telephony service providers, such as plain old telephone service ( post ). in certain embodiments, the carriers 104 comprise cellular telephony services. in certain embodiments, the carrier 104 comprise voice over digital network services wherein a users 106 voice signals are digitized and transmitted digitally over a multi - node network. in one embodiment, this can include a voice over internet protocol ( voip ) system. it will be understood that in various embodiments, communication among various elements of the system 100 can comprise multiple types of communication protocols. this can include multiple different protocols in a single communication as well as different types of protocol in different communication directions. for example, in one embodiment, a user 106 can place a voice - based communication, such as via a landline or cellular telephony call. the user 106 can receive a text or other graphics based communication that need not necessarily include voice protocol communication. in certain embodiments, the user 106, for example, may send and / or receive a communication including both voice protocol and text or other graphics based communication protocols in combination. fig2 illustrates schematically one embodiment of a telecommunication device 200 in a telecommunication system 100 offering an advertising / revenue system 102. in this embodiment, the telecommunication device 200 comprises a cellular telephony hand set. however, it will be understood that in other implementations, a telecommunications device 200 comprising a head set apparatus, a wired or wireless landline telephony set, personal computer, personal digital assistant ( pda ) and / or other types of telecommunication devices 200 can be advantageously employed according to one or more embodiments as described herein. in this embodiment, a user 106 has indicated a first telecommunication target 110 corresponding, in this implementation, to a numeric telephone number. in certain embodiments, indicating a first telecommunication target 110 comprises sequentially entering the digits of a phone number. in other embodiments, the indicating the first communication target 110 comprises selecting a presented number, for example using a graphical user interface ( gui ) cursor. the presented number can be selected from a pre - defined list, e. g. a list of contacts and / or can be selected from a newly generated list, e. g. from a directory assistance search. in certain embodiments, the user 106 can indicate a first telecommunication target 110 via a surrogate symbol and / or image. for example, a user 106 can direct a cursor to text reading bob & # 39 ; s plumbing to indicate their interest in contacting the associated plumbing business, but an associated telephone number need not be displayed or entered by the user 106. in response to the indication of the first communication target 110, the system 100, 102 provides the user 106 with related content 114. in one embodiment, the related content 114 corresponds to a plurality of possible second communication targets 112 a, 112 b, and 112 c. in this embodiment, the possible second communication targets, 112 a - 112 c are related to the first indicated communication target 110 by sharing a common industry, e. g. plumbing services. in this embodiment, the content 114 corresponding to possible second communication targets 112 a - 112 c is presented graphically as text based data corresponding to the services and contact information for the second communication targets 112 a - 112 c. in one implementation, the content 114 provided by the system 100, 102 can be considered as targeted advertising related to the users 106 manifested interest in establishing communication with the first communication target 110. thus, in one implementation, the user 106 is provided with content 114 that is related to their manifested desire to establish communication. the content 114 can inform the user 106 of possible second communication targets 112 a - 112 c that might offer more convenient times and / or locations of service, better pricing, and / or higher quality ratings than that of their initially selected first communication target 110. as in certain embodiments, the system 100, 102 provides the content 114 to the user 106 upon their indication of a first communication target 110, the likelihood that the user 106 would perceive the content 114 as intrusive or unwanted is reduced. in addition, the content 114 can be provided to the user 106 in a variety of timely manners. in certain embodiments, the content 114 is provided to the user 106 before establishment of communication with the first communication target 110. for example, the user 106 can enter / select a telephone number for the first communication target 110 with the telecommunication device 200. the system 102 is, in certain embodiments, adapted to present the content 114 before communication is established with the first communication target 110. this provides the user 106 the option of selecting the content 114 rather than completing a connection with the first communication target 110. in certain embodiments, the system 102 is adapted to present the content 114 for an extended period. for example, in one embodiment, while the user 106 is communicating with the first communication target 110, the content 114 continues to be provided. if, for example, the first communication target 110 provides less than satisfactory pricing, availability, etc. the user 106 can select the content 114 to explore other options. in certain embodiments, the content 114 is available to the user 106 after completing communication with the first communication target 110. the content 114 can include coupons or advertisements that the user 106 can save for later use. in certain embodiments, the system 100 is further configured such that a user 106 can access a desired portion of the content 114 at a later time. for example, in one embodiment, the user 106 can select one or more items from the content 114 that are of interest to save for later use. the system 100, 102 also provides the advantage to the possible second communication targets 112 a - 112 c of presenting the content 114 corresponding to their services to the user 106 at a time when the user 106 has clearly manifested an interest in obtaining services similar to those provided by the possible second communication targets 112 a - 112 c. the system 110, 102 thus facilitates presenting telecommunication possibilities between users 106 and second communication targets 112 in a convenient manner and in a manner matching parties likely having a high level of interest in each other. fig3 illustrates schematically another embodiment of a telecommunication device 200 in a telecommunication system 100 including an advertising / revenue system 102. in this embodiment, the telecommunication 200 comprises a personal computer configured for voice over digital network capability, a pda including voice and graphics communication capability and / or an advanced cellular telephony set including voice and graphics communication capability. fig3 also illustrates that in certain implementations, the system 100, 102 provides support for a plurality of first communication targets 110. for example, a user 106 may have multiple first communication targets corresponding, for example, to plumbing services 110 a, a book store 110 b, a dentist 110 c, a pet store 110 d, a travel agency 110 e, and charter jet services 110 f. upon selection of a first communication target 110 a corresponding to plumbing services, the system 100, 102 presents content 114 corresponding to one or more possible second communication targets 112 a, 112 b also related to plumbing services. the content 114 can include discounts or coupons as incentives for the user 106 to select one or more of the second communication targets 112 a, 112 b. alternatively, the system 100, 102 also fully supports establishment of communication between the user 106 and the first communication target 110, thereby providing advantageous options to the user 106 without compromising or impairing their ability to establish communication as originally desired. fig4 illustrates a process flow of one embodiment of a method of providing advertising and / or revenue generation in a telecommunication system, referred to hereafter as the method 300 for brevity. in a first block 302, a user 106 initiates communication. as previously indicated, the block 302 can include actual placement of a telecommunication call, however can also include simply indicating a desired communication. for example, the block 302 can include a user 106 indicating a desired communication target without actual establishment of the communication. following block 302 is a block 304 wherein access is made to the advertising / revenue system 102. the access of block 304 includes sharing of information indicative of the user & # 39 ; s 106 intention from block 302. thus, in various implementations, the accessing of block 304 can include sharing of information related to the user & # 39 ; s identification, the user & # 39 ; s location, the time and date of the initiation of block 302, the identification of the user & # 39 ; s indicated communication target, a geographic location of the intended communication target, and / or other related parameters of the user & # 39 ; s indicated communication desires from block 302. it will be understood that in certain embodiments the access of block 304 can include historical data, for example, data indicative of the user & # 39 ; s 106 previous communication history. following from the access of block 304, the user 106 is provided with related content 114 in a block 306. as previously noted, the content 114 is related to the user & # 39 ; s 106 initial communication request from block 302. for example, the content 114 can correspond to similar services to the user & # 39 ; s initial communication of block 302. the provision of content in block 306 can occur prior to the establishment of the communication requested in block 302, concurrently with establishment of communication requested in block 302, and / or following the communication requested in block 302. thus, in one implementation, the content 114 provided in block 306 can include advertisements or coupons for services related to those requested initially in the block 302 which the user 106 can store or save for later use. in certain implementations, the content 114 provided in block 306 can be elected instead by the user 106 such that the communication initially requested in block 302 is not established as initially requested but instead the user 106 establishes communication with an alternative second communication target 112. in a block 310, if the content from block 306 is selected, this action is recorded. the recording of block 310 provides trending and historical recordation of usage of the system 100, 102. this can be utilized in a block 312 to update the advertising / revenue system 102 based on the content 114 selected. for example, if a user 106 selects a particular second communication target 112, the method 300 can record and update this data, for example to increase the ranking of the second communication target 112 selected. in one embodiment, selection of the content 114 in a block 310 can result in a fee from a second communication target 112 for selection of their content 114. similarly, a commission can be paid to a carrier 104 for providing the user 106 with the content 114. fig5 illustrates one embodiment of a telecommunication system 100 including an advertising / revenue system 102. in one embodiment, the advertising / revenue system 102 comprises an advertising database 120. the advertising database 120 stores data to facilitate the system & # 39 ; s 102 ability to more efficiently provide relevant content 114 to users 106. in various implementations, the advertising database 120 can include information related to a user & # 39 ; s previous calling history, a plurality of advertisements that can be provided as the content 114, and / or records of fees to be selected and commissions to be paid. as will be understood by one of ordinary skill, the advertising database 120 can be arranged in a plurality of configurations and can be organized or sorted on a plurality of parameters. various exemplary implementations of organizational parameters will be described in greater detail following with reference to fig7. in one embodiment, the advertising / revenue system 102 also comprises an advertising system application server 122. the application server 122 provides a management and control function to the system 102. for example, in one embodiment, the application server 122 is adapted to access the advertising database 120 and obtain relevant content 114 based on the particulars of a given user & # 39 ; s call. in certain implementations, the application server 122 also facilitates establishment of a communication between a user 106 and a second communication target 112 based on selection of the content 114. for example, upon selection of content 114 of interest, a user & # 39 ; s 106 communication request can pass through or be brokered by the advertising / revenue system 102 for connection to the second communication target 112. this aspect facilitates tracking of use of the system 102 to facilitate updating of the advertising database 120. for example, in one embodiment, upon selection of content 114 by the user 106, the application server 122 updates in the advertising database 120 that a commission is due a carrier 104 for supporting the communication and a fee is due from a second communication target 112 for the user 106 selecting content 114 associated with that second communication target 112. in various implementations, the advertising database 120 and application server 122 comprise both long term memory or storage as well as short term memory that can comprise volatile memory. the advertising database 120 and application server 122 can be implemented as a microprocessor based system with appropriate operating software. the advertising database 120 and application server 122 can be implemented as a stand - alone centrally located system, a local area network ( lan ), and / or a wide area network ( wan ). in one embodiment, the advertising / revenue system 102 further comprises an advertising system website 124. the advertising system website 124 provides a convenient interactive system for access to the advertising / revenue system 102. in one embodiment, advertisers 130 can access the advertising system website 124, for example to create or update an advertisement, to submit payment for services, and / or to place bid amounts for content 114 relating to their business. in certain implementations, access by an advertiser 130 to the advertising system website 124 proceeds in a secure manner, for example requiring a particular encryption protocol and / or appropriate passwords or security codes. these implementations provide the advantage of maintaining confidentiality between a given advertiser 130 and other advertisers 130 also employing services of the advertising / revenue system 102. for example, a first advertiser 130 can bid for placement of content 114 associated with their business via the advertising system website 124, however without access to information related to bids or advertisements of other advertisers 130. in one embodiment, the system 100 also includes multiple format capable network services 140. the network services 140 are adapted to support a plurality of communication formats and protocols. fig5 illustrates that the network services 140 are adapted to support communication with a first format 142 and a second format 144. it will be understood, however that a wide variety of communication formats and capabilities exist and are in continuing development. thus the illustration and description of the first format 142 and second format 144 are simply illustrative of one embodiment and can be readily adapted by one of ordinary skill to support additional existing formats and formats to be developed. in one embodiment, the first format 142 comprises voice telephony, such as wired or land line telephony and cellular voice telephony. thus, in one embodiment, the system 100, 102 is adapted to support voice based communication. in one embodiment, the communication via the user 106 and the communication targets 110, 112 proceeds as voice communication. in this embodiment, the content 114 is also provided to the user 106 as an audible message and the user 106 has the option of selecting the content 114 via a voice based response as shown in fig6. in one embodiment, the second format 144 comprises expanded communication capabilities, such as combining voice and text or other data. for example, in various implementations, the second format 144 can comprise one or more voips. the second format 144 can comprise third generation ( 3g ) or later advanced cellular telephony systems, for example including short message services ( sms ). thus, in certain embodiments, communication between a user 106 and the advertising / revenue system 102 can proceed via both voice based and text or other data based formats. these embodiments provide expanded capabilities in presenting the content 114 to the user 106 as well as for the user 106 to select and store the content 114. the multiple format capable network service 140 also provides increased flexibility in utilization of the capabilities of the advertising / revenue system 102. for example, in one implementation, voice communication between a user 106 and a communication target 110, 112 can proceed in a bidirectional or full duplex manner as many people have become accustomed to in telecommunication. the advertising / revenue system 102 can also support presentation of the content 114 in an asynchronous half - duplex manner. for example, in one implementation, text or other graphics based content 114 can be provided to the user 106 while the user 106 is conducting a voice communication without interruption or otherwise disturbing their full duplex voice telecommunication. thus, the advertising / revenue system 102 can present the user 106 with additional information and options with reduced impact on their existing expectations for voice communication. fig7 illustrates one embodiment of an advertising database 120 of a telecommunication advertising / revenue system 102. as indicated in fig7, the advertising system database 120 comprises a plurality of parameters 150 under which the database 120 can be accessed or managed to facilitate operation of the system 102. in one embodiment, the advertising database 120 comprises a parameter data that can be linked by a user & # 39 ; s identification, e. g. their telephone number, to provide more relevant content 114 to the user. for example, the user sorting parameter 150 a can include the user & # 39 ; s 106 gender, age, marital status, previous calling history, social and / or business relationships, etc. in one embodiment, the advertising database 120 also comprises a communication target sorting parameter 150 b. in this embodiment, the system 102 can correlate or sort the content 114 to be provided based at least partially on an identification of the communication target. for example, if a user 106 indicates their desire to establish communication with a first communication target 110 that provides pizza delivery services, the advertising database 120 can be sorted to provide content 114 related to other pizza delivery services. in one embodiment, the advertising database 120 comprises a temporal sorting parameter 150 c. in this embodiment, the system 102 can sort the advertising database 120 based on a time and date parameter. for example, should a user 106 place a call on mother & # 39 ; s day or valentine & # 39 ; s day, the system 102 can provide content 114 including advertisements or contact information for florists and / or restaurants. similarly, should a user access their communication device 200, 200 in the late afternoon to early evening, the system 102 may provide content 114 including advertisements or contact information for food pickup or delivery services. in one embodiment, the advertising database 120 comprises a location sorting parameter 150 d. in this embodiment, the system 102 can access or manipulate the advertising database 120 based at least partially on the location of the communication. for example, as previously noted, in certain embodiments the advertising database 120 can include demographic information related to a user 106 including their home and / or mailing address. if the user 106 indicates a desire to establish communication in a geographical area significantly different from their home or billing address, the system 102 can present content 114 that is geographically appropriate. for example, if the user 106 initiates communication in a geographic location having many recreational opportunities, the system 102 can predict that the user 106 may be on vacation and can present content including contact information for museums, guide services, golf courses, etc. if the user 106 initiates communication indicating they are recently arrived at an airport, the system 102 can provide content 114 including contact information for local hotels, taxi services and / or rental car agencies. in certain embodiments, the advertising database 120 includes an ad placement bidding parameter 150 e. in certain embodiments, advertisers 130 can pay a proportional fee to increase the prominence with which their advertisements or contact information is presented in the content 114. for example, in certain implementations, an advertiser 130 can pay an increased fee to have their advertisement placed first or earlier in a listing of a plurality of advertisements. in other aspects, an advertiser 130 can pay an increased fee for a larger advertisement, an advertisement including color and / or other attractive graphics and / or an interactive link to make selection of their advertisements more convenient for the user 106. in certain embodiments, the advertising database 120 comprises a target ranking parameter 150 f. in certain embodiments, the advertising database 120 can include a feedback feature such that an advertiser 130 can accumulate a quality ranking from previous user & # 39 ; s experiences with that advertiser. in other aspects, the target ranking parameter 150 f can comprise a frequency or count aspect. for example, advertisers 130 whose content 114 is more frequently selected can accumulate a popularity ranking. the content 114 can thus in certain embodiments be presented in rank order based on the frequency with which the advertisers content 114 has been historically selected. in certain embodiments, the advertising database 120 also comprises an incentives parameter 150 g. as previously noted, the advertising / revenue system 102 can include a plurality of incentives for users 106, carriers 104, and / or advertisers 130 to utilize the system 102. in one implementation, users 106 can receive the incentive of reduced cost or free telecommunication services for establishing contact in response to the content 114. in certain implementations, a carrier or provider of telecommunication services 104 can receive a commission or payment for supporting communication between the users 106 and advertisers 130. the advertisers 130 can pay fees for the incentive of having their content 114 be provided to the users 106 by the system 102 such that the content 114 is received by users 106 having a high likelihood of interest in the advertisers services. in certain embodiments, the advertising database 120 comprises an industry sorting parameter 150 h. if a user 106 initiates communication with a given communication target, the system 102 can be adapted to cross - reference the advertising database in an industry sorting parameter 150 h to generate content 114 corresponding to related industries. for example, should a user 106 initiate a call to a plumbing services company or query a directory assistance for plumbing services contact information, the system 102 can cross - reference the advertising database 120 to generate content 114 providing contact information for advertisers 130 providing plumbing services. in another embodiment, if a user 106 completes a call to a first communication target 110 a comprising an airline, the system 102 can conclude that the user 106 successfully obtained the desired flight reservation services. as a component of the industry sorting parameter 150 h, the system 102 can provide content 114 in a related industry, for example contact information for rental car agencies. thus, various embodiments of the advertising / revenue system 102 provide advantages to multiple parties in a telecommunication system 100. users 106 can obtain the benefits of timely and relevant content 114 that can inform them of opportunities and new contacts which they might otherwise be unaware of or that might otherwise require determined effort to acquire. the content 114 can be provided to a user 106 when the user 106 has already exhibited interest in related information or services. this aspect reduces the likelihood that the content 114 will be perceived as intrusive or unwelcome. embodiments of the advertising / revenue system 102 can provide the advantages to carriers or communication services providers 104 of a direct revenue stream as well as increased customer traffic. for example, carriers 104 can receive commissions when users 106 or advertisers 130 utilize their telecommunication services as part of the system 100. the advertising / revenue system 102 can also be configured to provide incentives to users 106 and advertisers 130 encouraging their use of the system 100 such that even absent a direct revenue stream, the carriers 104 receive the benefits of increased utilization of their telecommunication services in response to use of the system 102. advertisers 130 receive the benefits of having their advertisements and / or contact information provided to users 106 in a particularly timely and relevant manner. advertisers 130 also receive the advantage of exposure of their services to a user 106 who may be initially trying to contact a competitor. advertisers 130 also receive the advantage of being able to configure the parameters under which an advertising database 120 presents their services as content 114 to a user 106. the system 102 also supports the ability for an advertiser 130 to bid proportionately for a display priority of their ad to increase the likelihood of a user 106 selecting their ad for further contact. although the above disclosed embodiments have shown, described and pointed out novel features of the invention as applied to the above - disclosed embodiments, it should be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form of the detail of the devices, systems and / or methods illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present teachings. consequently,

fig1, respective blocks are shown to logically identify the elements of the device. accordingly, the aforementioned elements of the device may be provided as one chip or a plurality of chips in accordance with design of the device. in the meantime, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide a dual mode of a child mode and an adult mode. to this end, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide two lock states of a first lock state and a second lock state, and may provide a first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state and a second unlock interface for unlocking the second lock state. hereinafter, a description as to a lock state set in accordance with a dual mode and when the lock state is set will be made, and a mode provided when the lock state is unlocked in accordance with the first unlock interface and the second unlock interface will be described. first of all, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide the first unlock interface that unlocks the first lock state. the first lock state is the state that input of the user or occurrence of an event is on standby. accordingly, if the mobile device enters the first lock state, it may make a screen become an off state in the form of a dark screen until it detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event. in other words, in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption, the mobile device may enter the first lock state if a previously set time passes without input of the user or occurrence of an event. at this time, the mobile device may enter the first lock state in a child mode or an adult mode. in other words, the mode for entering the first lock state is not limited to a specific mode, and the child mode and the adult mode may be the mode for entering the first lock state. the mobile device of the first lock state is on standby for input of the user or occurrence of an event. if the mobile device detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event, it may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state. the first unlock interface is an unlock interface provided if the mobile device of the first lock state detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event. also, the first unlock interface may unlock the first lock state and allow entrance to the child mode or adult mode. in other words, the mobile device may unlock the first lock state and enter into the child mode or adult mode in accordance with the input signal of the user for the first unlock interface. to this end, the first unlock interface may allow a first unlock signal for entrance to the child mode and a second unlock signal for entrance to the adult mode. if the mobile device detects the input signal for the first unlock interface, which is input by the user, it may determine whether the input signal is the first unlock signal for entrance to the child mode or the second unlock signal for entrance to the adult mode, and may enter into the child mode or the adult mode. fig2 is a diagram illustrating embodiments of a first unlock interface for unlocking a first lock state. the mobile device may enter into the child mode or the adult mode by receiving an unlock signal from the user through the first unlock interface. the unlock signal may be the signal generated if the user performs a touch input in accordance with a pattern which is previously set, as shown in ( a ) of fig2. also, the unlock signal may be the signal generated if the user inputs a series of numbers which are previously set, as shown in ( b ) of fig2. also, the unlock signal may be the signal generated if a fingerprint of the user is input as shown in ( c ) of fig2. at this time, the mobile device may further include a unit for fingerprint input to receive the fingerprint of the user. as described above, the unlock signal is intended to unlock the lock state of the mobile device, and may have various types such as text, number, touch pattern, and fingerprint. the unlock signal is not limited to a specific type. however, the mobile device may sense touch and hovering of the user for the screen, and may also sense a motion of the user based on the mobile device through a gyroscope sensor and recognize a voice. accordingly, the unlock signal may be generated by at least one of touch, hovering, fingerprint, motion and voice of the user. also, as shown in ( a ) to ( c ) of fig2, even though the first unlock interface receives different types of unlock signals, it receives the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode separately from the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. in other words, if the mobile device detects the first unlock signal for the first unlock interface, it may provide an environment based on the child mode after unlocking the lock state. if the mobile device detects the second unlock signal, it may provide an environment based on the adult mode after unlocking the lock state. in this respect, the unlock signal will be described as an example of the signal generated when the user performs a touch input in accordance with a pattern which is previously set, as shown in ( a ) of fig2. fig3 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a first lock state enters into a child mode through a first unlock signal for a first unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment. since the child mode means that the user is a child, as shown in ( a ) of fig3, the mobile device 300 may set a first unlock signal in accordance with a pattern 310 which is easy for children to remember or input. the mobile device 300 may basically provide the pattern 310 for the first unlock signal, and the user may previously set the pattern 310 for the first unlock signal through the mobile device 300. if the mobile device 300 detects the first unlock signal, it may provide a user interface 320 implemented in the child mode as shown in ( b ) of fig3. the user interface 320 may include at least one application implemented in the child mode. as described above, if the mobile device 300 enters into the child mode, among at least one application installed in the mobile device 300, the application set to be performed in the child mode may only be displayed. the application which is not allowed to be used in the child mode cannot be displayed. this will be described in detail with reference to fig1. fig4 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a first lock state enters into an adult mode through a second unlock signal for a first unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment. since the adult mode means that the user is an adult, as shown in ( a ) of fig4, the mobile device 400 may set a second unlock signal in accordance with a complicated pattern 410 which is difficult for children to unlock the lock state. the mobile device 400 according to one embodiment may set a first unlock signal for entering into the child mode differently from a second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. as a result, it is advantageous in that data of the mobile device may be prevented from being deleted due to mistake or error manipulation of the child and contents harmful to children may be blocked. accordingly, if the pattern for the second unlock signal is the pattern which is difficult for the child to remember, the above advantages may be more increased. also, the mobile device 400 may basically provide the pattern 410 for the second unlock signal, and the user may previously set the pattern 410 for the second unlock signal through the mobile device 400. if the mobile device 400 detects the second unlock signal, it may provide a user interface 420 implemented in the adult mode as shown in ( b ) of fig4. the user interface 420 may include at least one application implemented in the adult mode. if necessary, the user interface implemented in the adult mode may display all the applications installed in the mobile device 400. the user of the adult mode may identify the application implemented in the child mode by allowing the user of the adult mode to view the application implemented in the child mode, and may set the mode where the application is implemented. this will be described in more detail with reference to fig1. in the meantime, the mobile device may provide a call transmission and reception function, a message transmission and reception function and an e - mail transmission and reception function. at this time, if the child of the user receives a call or text message related to business of the user with using the mobile device of the user, a problem may occur in business of the user. accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the above functions to be used in the adult mode only. however, in case of a function in which event processing is important at the time when an event occurs, such as the function for call reception, the mobile device may allow the user to enter into the adult mode and process the corresponding event by notifying the user that the event has occurred even though it restricts event processing in the child mode. as a result, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the user to immediately process an event regarded by the user to be important or an event of which processing is important at the time when the event occurs. this will be described with reference to fig5 and fig6. fig5 is a diagram illustrating that an event for an adult mode occurs in a mobile device of a child mode in accordance with one embodiment. it is assumed that the mobile device detects the first unlock signal for the first unlock interface unlocking the first lock state and enters into the child mode. ( a ) of fig5 illustrates that the mobile device of the child mode displays an implementation screen of a specific application 510 implemented in the child mode. when the mobile device of the child mode implements the specific application 510, it may detect an event for the adult mode. the event means occurrence of an operation or work that affects implementation of an application or task of the mobile device, and may occur when an operation or work generated by the user occurs or data are received from an external device. for example, the mobile device may detect occurrence of the event if it receives a call, text message or e - mail. however, if the mobile device is allowed to process such an event even in the child mode, a problem may occur in that the user of the mobile device may miss an important call or message due to the child. accordingly, the mobile device may be set such that event processing cannot be processed in the child mode. in other words, the mobile device may process an event in the adult mode only. however, the mobile device of the child mode may detect occurrence of the event even though it cannot process the event. accordingly, if the mobile device of the child mode detects occurrence of the event, it may enter into the adult mode to process the event. if the mobile device detects an event for the adult mode in the child mode, as shown in ( b ) of fig5, it may enter a second lock state and display a second unlock interface 520 that unlocks the mobile device of the second lock state. at this time, the second unlock interface 520 may display information 521 related to the detected event. the second lock state is on standby for input of the user. if the mobile device detects the event for the adult mode in the child mode, it may enter the second lock state. also, the mobile device may enter the second lock state and at the same time may display the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state. hereinafter, the first lock state and the second lock state, and the first unlock interface and the second unlock interface will be described in more detail. first of all, the mobile device may enter the first lock state in the child mode or adult mode. in other words, the mobile device may enter the first lock state regardless of the fact that the current mode is the child mode or the adult mode if there is no input of the user or occurrence of an event until a previously set time passes. on the other hand, the mobile device may enter the second lock state in the child mode only. in other words, the mobile device may enter the second lock state only if it detects the event for the adult mode in the current child mode. also, the mobile device that has entered the first lock state is on standby for input of the user or occurrence of the event. accordingly, the mobile device that has entered the first lock state may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state if it detect the input of the user or occurrence of the event. on the other hand, the mobile device that has entered the second lock state is in the state that it detects the event for the adult mode. accordingly, the mobile device may enter the second lock state and at the same time provide the second unlock interface for unlocking the second lock state. in other words, the first unlock interface is provided if the input of the user or occurrence of the event is detected in the first lock state, whereas the second unlock interface may be provided at the same time when the mobile device enters the second lock state. also, the first unlock interface may allow both the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode and the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. however, the second unlock interface may allow only the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. this is because that the mobile device should enter into the adult mode to allow the user to process the event as the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode. accordingly, the second unlock interface may entrance to the adult mode only after unlocking the lock state. also, the second unlock interface is different from the first unlock interface, which receives the unlock signal only, in that it includes information on the event. ( b ) of fig5 illustrates that information 521 on an event includes caller information and caller number together with a call icon for notifying occurrence of an event for call reception. for example, if the mobile device detects an event for message reception, information related to the event may include at least one of message sender information, message sender number and message together with a message icon for notifying occurrence of the event for message reception. in other words, the information on the event may include information that may allow the user to identify the event, for example, information as to what the generated event is. fig6 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment. in the same manner as fig5, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface. as shown in ( a ) of fig6, the mobile device may detect a second unlock signal 611 for the second unlock interface 610. the mobile device that has detected the second unlock signal 611 may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode. also, the mobile device that has unlocked the second lock state through the second unlock interface 610 and entered into the adult mode may process the detected event. if the event detected by the mobile device is the event for call reception, as shown in ( b ) of fig6, the mobile device may receive a call. at this time, the mobile device may enter into the adult mode and at the same time process the event for call reception even though there is no separate input of the user. even though the user does not perform a touch or input for a call, the operation of entrance to the adult mode through the second unlock interface 610 may be regarded as that for call reception. if the mobile device receives an input signal of the user, which is for event processing, after entering into the adult mode, it may process the detected event. however, in the same manner as that a call ends, the mobile device that has completely processed the detected event may enter the first lock state as shown in ( c ) of fig6, and may provide the first unlock interface 620 for unlocking the first lock state. as described above, the first unlock interface 620 may allow the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode and the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. accordingly, if the user intends to perform additional task in the adult mode, the user may unlock the first lock state by inputting the second unlock signal and enter into the adult mode. on the other hand, if the user desires to enter into the child mode to allow the child to use the mobile device, the user may unlock the first lock state by inputting the first unlock signal and enter into the child mode. as described above, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may enter the first lock state and provide the first unlock interface, whereby the user may enter into a desired mode to perform a desired task. however, after the detected event is completely processed, it may be more preferable for the user that the mobile device continues to implement the application implemented in the child mode. also, it may be more preferable that the mobile device maintains the adult mode to allow the user to perform additional task after the detected event is completely processed. this will be described in more detail with reference to fig7 and fig8. first of all, fig7 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with another embodiment. in the same manner as fig5, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface. as shown in ( a ) of fig7, the mobile device may detect a second unlock signal 711 for a second unlock interface 710. the mobile device that has detected the second unlock signal 711 may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode. also, the mobile device that has entered into the adult mode may process the detected event. ( b ) of fig7 illustrates an event for call reception as an example of the detected event. as described above, the mobile device may process the event simultaneously with unlocking the second lock state or may process the event if there is a request of the user after unlocking the second lock state. at this time, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may automatically be switched from the adult mode to the child mode. as a result, as shown in ( c ) of fig7, the mobile device may continue to implement the application 720 implemented at the time when detecting the event. also, in a state that the mobile device displays the first unlock interface after entering the first lock state as shown in ( c ) of fig6, if the user enters into the child mode through the first unlock signal, the mobile device may continue to implement the application implemented at the time when detecting the event. however, as shown in ( c ) of fig7, if the mobile device continues to implement the application which is being implemented, without entering the lock state, the user does not need to unlock the lock state, whereby convenience is improved. this is because that the adult has only to pass the mobile device to the child. fig8 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with other embodiment. in the same manner as fig5, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface. also, since ( a ) of fig8 and ( b ) of fig8 are the same as ( a ) of fig6 and ( b ) of fig6 and ( a ) of fig7 and ( b ) of fig7, their detailed description will be omitted. as shown in ( a ) of fig8, if the mobile device detects a second unlock signal for a second unlock interface, it may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode. also, as shown in ( b ) of fig8, the mobile device that has entered into the adult mode may process the detected event. at this time, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may provide a basic home screen 810 provided in the adult mode as shown in ( c ) of fig8. the basic home screen may include an icon corresponding to at least one application implemented in the adult mode. if the event for the adult mode occurs in the mobile device of the child mode, a task related to the event may be performed even after the event is completed. for example, the user who has ended a call may make an important note or should write and send a mail in respect of the call message. accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the user to continue to perform a necessary task by maintaining the adult mode after processing the event. also, although the mobile device may continue to maintain the adult mode, it may maintain the adult mode for a previously set time after the event is completely processed and may switch the adult mode to the child mode after the previously set time is exceeded. for example, the mobile device may automatically switch the adult mode to the child mode if the previously set time is exceeded without input of the user or occurrence of the event after processing the event. as described above, the mobile device may perform the task related to the event by maintaining the adult mode for a given time. afterwards, the mobile device may return to the child mode to continue to implement the application implemented in the child mode, whereby user convenience may be increased. in the meantime, as shown in ( a ) of fig6, ( a ) of fig7 and ( a ) of fig8, if the mobile device of the child mode may enter the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and displays the second unlock interface, it may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode. for example, the mobile device that has received a call, that is, the mobile device that has detected the event for call reception may press a previously set button or reject a received call by touching a menu button on the screen. alternatively, the mobile device that has detected the event for message reception, the event for mail reception, etc. may turn off an alarm function even though the user does not check the message or mail. as described above, the rejection of the received call or turn - off of the alarm function for message reception or mail reception may be regarded as event processing. however, if the function for processing the event is able to be performed in the child mode, the user may miss the important event processing due to the child. accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment of the present specification may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode by detecting the event for the adult mode in the child mode. as described above, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, it may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode. alternatively, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, since it enters the second lock state and displays the second unlock interface, it may disable the function for processing the event at the second lock state. accordingly, the child may be prevented from rejecting the received call or the user may be prevented from missing the important call or message due to turn - off of the message alarm function. fig9 is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state provides information guiding mode switching in accordance with one embodiment. as shown in ( a ) of fig9, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, it may enter the second lock state and provide a second unlock interface 910. the second unlock interface 910 may include information 911 related to the detected event. also, the second unlock interface 910 may allow only a second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. in other words, the second unlock interface 910 does not allow the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode. however, as shown in ( a ) of fig9, the mobile device may detect the first unlock signal 913 for entering into the child mode, with respect to the second unlock interface 910. this is because that the child who is using the mobile device in the child mode may input the first unlock signal 913 to enter into the child mode from the lock state. accordingly, the mobile device may provide information 920 that guides mode switching from the child mode to the adult mode. the information 920 guiding mode switching from the child mode to the adult mode may be displayed as a graphic image as shown in ( b ) of fig9. however, the information guiding mode switching is not limited to the graphic image and may also be provided as a voice guide message. in the meantime, at least one application provided in the mobile device according to one embodiment may include at least one application implemented in the child mode only, at least one application implemented in the adult mode only, and at least one application implemented in the child mode and the adult mode. accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide a first setup interface that configures a mode for implementing the provided application. fig1 is a diagram illustrating a first setup interface for an application provided by a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment. as shown in fig1, the first setup interface may include an application interface 1010 displaying at least one application provided in the mobile device, an adult application interface 1020 displaying at least one application which will be implemented in the adult mode, and a child application interface 1030 displaying at least one application which will be implemented in the child mode. the first setup interface may provide an environment where the user may shift an icon corresponding to the application included in the application interface 1010 to the adult application interface 1020 and the child application interface 1030 through an input method such as a touch. at this time, the application included in the application interface 1010 may be shifted to the adult application interface 1020 and the child application interface 1030. in this case, the corresponding application may be implemented in both the adult mode and the child mode. in other words, the application may be implemented in the child mode only, or the adult mode only, and may be implemented in both the child mode and the adult mode in accordance with configuration. also, the first setup interface may be provided in the adult mode. this is because that it is not reasonable to allow the child, who is the user of the child mode, to determine an application and a mode to be implemented. however, in case of the application which will be implemented in the child mode, the main user of the corresponding application is the child. accordingly, the mobile device may provide a second setup interface, which configures an environment for implementing at least one application in the child mode, in the child mode. fig1 is a diagram illustrating a second setup interface for an application provided by a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment. the second setup interface 1110 may configure an environment for implementing at least one application in the child mode. the environment may include all the items that may be configured by the user when the user implements the application, such as the time when the application is implemented, sound control when the application is implemented, and brightness control when the application is implemented. also, the second setup interface 1110 may provide a user interface ( ui ) that may easily configure the environment of the application to be implemented in the child mode. accordingly, even in case of the same application, if the environment is configured in the child mode, a user interface different from the user interface provided in the adult mode may be provided to be acquainted with the child. fig1 is a block diagram illustrating that mode switching is performed between a child mode and an adult mode in a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment. hereinafter, the mode switching procedure between the child mode and the adult mode will be described together with the first lock state and the second lock state. if the mobile device is powered on, it may enter the first lock state 1210. the first lock state 1210 is the state that input of the user or occurrence of the event is on standby. the mobile device may configure the first lock state 1210 in case of the power - on state, and may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state 1210 to allow the user to use the mobile device. the mobile device of the first lock state 1210 may enter into the child mode 1220 or the adult mode 1260 in accordance with the unlock signal detected through the first unlock interface. the unlock signal may be configured previously, and may be varied after being configured. in other words, if the mobile device of the first lock state 1210 detects the first unlock signal, it may enter into the child mode 1220. if the mobile device of the first lock state 1210 detects the second unlock signal, it may enter into the adult mode 1260. in the meantime, after the mobile device of the first lock state 1210 enters into the child mode 1220 or the adult mode 1260, if there is no input of the user or occurrence of the event for a previously set time, or in accordance with the request of the user, the mobile device may enter the first lock state 1210. in this way, as the mobile device enters the first lock state from the child mode or the adult mode, it may reduce unnecessary power consumption, especially reduce unnecessary and frequent reaction of a touch sensor display. also, if the mobile device of the child mode 1220 detects the event for the adult mode, it may enter the second lock state 1230. the second lock state 1230 is the state that the input of the user is on standby. the mobile device may prepare entrance to the adult mode by entering the second lock state 1230 to process the detected event. in other words, if the mobile device detects the event for the adult mode, it may provide the second lock state and the second unlock interface to allow the user to input the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. if the mobile device of the second lock state 1230 detects the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode in accordance with the input of the user, it may enter into the adult mode to process the detect event ( 1240 ). at this time, the adult mode may be the same mode as the adult mode 1260 entering at the first lock state, and for convenience of description, these adult modes are shown at different blocks. however, the mobile device that has completely processed the event ( 1240 ) may enter the first lock state 1210, and may enter into the adult mode or the child mode in accordance with the configuration. this will be described in more detail with reference to fig1 to fig1. in the meantime, if the mobile device of the second lock state 1230 detects the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, in accordance with the input of the user, it may send an error report 1250 and maintain the second lock state 1230. the second lock state 1230 may allow the entrance to the adult mode only unlike the first lock state that allows the entrance to the child mode and the adult mode. this is intended to process the event for the adult mode. accordingly, if the mobile device receives the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, it may send the error report 1250 to allow the user to input the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. at this time, the error report 1250 may include information guiding mode switching. in the meantime, fig1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment. as described with reference to fig2 to fig4, the mobile device may provide the first unlock interface that unlocks the first lock state ( s 1300 ). also, as described with reference to fig3, if the mobile device enters into the child mode through the first unlock interface, it may display at least one application implemented in the child mode. at this time, as described with reference to fig5, the mobile device may detect the event for the adult mode ( s 1320 ). the event means occurrence of operation or work that affects implementation of the application or task. the event may occur when the operation or work generated by the user occurs or data are received from the external device. as described with reference to fig6 to fig8, the mobile device that has detected the event may enter the second lock state ( s 1330 ), and may provide the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state ( s 1340 ). the second unlock interface may allow the entrance to the adult mode only. accordingly, the mobile device may enter into the adult mode and process the detected event only if the user enters the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. after the mobile device processes the detected event, it may enter into the child mode again and maintain the adult mode. also, the mobile device may enter the first lock state and enter into the child mode or the adult mode in accordance with the unlock signal input by the user. in other words, the mode or lock state entering after the mobile device processes the detected event may be varied depending on the configuration. this will be described in detail with reference to fig1 to fig1. fig1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a mobile device in accordance with another embodiment. as described with reference to fig5, the mobile device may detect the event for the adult mode while a specific application is being implemented in the child mode ( s 1400 ). the mobile device that has detected the event may enter the second lock state ( s 1410 ), and may provide the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state ( s 1420 ). the mobile device may enter the second lock state and provide the second unlock interface at the same time. as described with reference to fig6 to fig8, the mobile device may detect whether the signal input by the user through the second unlock interface is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode or the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode ( s 1430 ). the second unlock interface allows the entrance to the adult mode only. accordingly, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, the mobile device may disable the function for processing the detected event ( s 1440 ). this is intended to block event processing to prevent the event for the adult mode from being rejected to be processed or being processed in the child mode. also, as described with reference to fig9, the mobile device may provide information that guides mode switching ( s 1450 ). also, the mobile device may disable the function for processing the detected event in the child mode, if it detects the event, regardless of the detected signal of the first unlock signal or the second unlock signal. in the meantime, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode, the mobile device may process the event after entering into the adult mode ( s 1460 ). at this time, if the mobile device detects the second unlock signal, it may enter into the adult mode and at the same time process the event. for example, if the event is the event for call reception, the mobile device may enter into the adult mode and at the same time connect a call. if the event is the event for message reception, the mobile device may enter into the adult mode and at the same time display the received message. as described with reference to fig6, the mobile device may enter the first lock state after completely processing the event ( s 1470 ). the mobile device may provide the user with an opportunity of selecting the adult mode or the child mode by entering the first lock state and displaying the first unlock interface. the mobile device may detect whether the signal input by the user through the first unlock interface is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode or the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode ( s 1480 ). the first unlock interface may allow both the entrance to the child mode and the entrance to the adult mode unlike the second unlock interface that allows the entrance to the adult mode only. as described with reference to fig3, if the mobile device detects the first unlock signal, it may continue to implement the specific application which is being implemented in the child mode ( s 1490 ). if the user inputs the first unlock signal, it means that the user intends to continue to perform the work, which is being implemented before the event occurs, by entering into the child mode. accordingly, the mobile device may continue to implement the specific application, which is being implemented before the event occurs, by entering into the child mode, whereby convenience of the user may be improved. also, as described with reference to fig4, if the mobile device detects the second unlock signal, it may display at least one application implemented in the adult mode ( s 1500 ). fig1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a mobile device in accordance with still another embodiment. as described with reference to fig5, the mobile device may detect the event for the adult mode while a specific application is being implemented in the child mode ( s 1510 ). the mobile device that has detected the event may enter the second lock state ( s 1520 ), and may provide the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state ( s 1530 ). as described with reference to fig6 to fig8, the mobile device may detect whether the signal input by the user through the second unlock interface is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode or the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode ( s 1540 ). the second unlock interface allows the entrance to the adult mode only. accordingly, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, the mobile device may disable the function for processing the detected event ( s 1550 ). this is intended to block event processing to prevent the event for the adult mode from being rejected to be processed or being processed in the child mode. also, as described with reference to fig9, the mobile device may provide information that guides mode switching ( s 1560 ). in the meantime, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode, the mobile device may process the event after entering into the adult mode ( s 1570 ). as described with reference to fig7, the mobile device may enter into the child mode again after completely processing the event ( s 1580 ). also, the mobile device may continue to implement the specific application which is being implemented in the child mode ( s 1590 ). as described above, if the event is completely processed, the mobile device may automatically enter into the mode before the event occurs. accordingly, since the user does not need to take any action for mode switching, the user may feel convenience. fig1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a mobile device in accordance with further still another embodiment. as described with reference to fig5, the mobile device may detect the event for the adult mode while a specific application is being implemented in the child mode ( s 1600 ). the mobile device that has detected the event may enter the second lock state ( s 1610 ), and may provide the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state ( s 1620 ). as described with reference to fig6 to fig8, the mobile device may detect whether the signal input by the user through the second unlock interface is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode or the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode ( s 1630 ). the second unlock interface allows the entrance to the adult mode only. accordingly, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, the mobile device may disable the function for processing the detected event ( s 1640 ). this is intended to block event processing to prevent the event for the adult mode from being rejected to be processed or being processed in the child mode. also, as described with reference to fig9, the mobile device may provide information guiding mode switching ( s 1650 ). in the meantime, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode, the mobile device may process the event after entering into the adult mode ( s 1660 ). as described with reference to fig8, the mobile device that has completely processed the event may display at least one application implemented in the adult mode with maintaining the adult mode without performing separate mode switching ( s 1670 ). generally, after the event occurs, it is likely that the user may perform additional work by using the mobile device. accordingly, the mobile device may maintain the adult mode for a certain time period without mode switching after the event ends, whereby the user may use the mobile device conveniently. also, if a certain time period is exceeded, the mobile device may automatically enter into the child mode ( s 1680 ) and continue to perform the work implemented in the child mode. in other words, if the mobile device detects the input of the user or occurrence of the event within a previously set time, it may continue to maintain the adult mode. however, if the mobile device fails to detect the input of the user or occurrence of the event within a previously set time, it may enter into the child mode. fig1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a mobile device in accordance with further still another embodiment. as described with reference to fig2, the mobile device may provide the first unlock interface that unlocks the first lock state ( s 1700 ). also, as described with reference to fig4, if the mobile device enters into the adult mode through the first unlock interface, it may display at least one application implemented in the adult mode. also, if the mobile device detects the event for the adult mode ( s 1720 ), it may process the event. in other words, the mobile device may enter the second lock state if it detects the event for the adult mode, whereas the mobile device may immediately process the

"reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. while the embodiments will be described in conjunction with the drawings, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the embodiments. on the contrary, the embodiments are intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents. furthermore, in the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. however, it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. in other instances, well - known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments. for expository purposes, the terms axially or axial direction refer to a direction along a centerline axis length of a shaft, e. g., along centerline axis 101 of shaft 140 in fig1, and radially or radial direction refer to a direction perpendicular to the centerline axis 101. the term horizontal as used herein refers to a plane parallel to the plane or surface of an object, regardless of its orientation. the term vertical refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. terms such as above, below, bottom, top, side, higher, lower, upper, over, and under are referred to with respect to the horizontal plane. embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for reducing relative radial motion between the head and a given data track. embodiments described herein are particularly effective at reducing relative radial motion at certain frequencies, e. g., 1000 hz or higher, that do not follow a repeating pattern but are not limited thereto. for example, radial motion of the disk and data tracks caused by a phenomenon known as windage is reduced. accordingly, amplitudes of disk modes are reduced, thereby enabling the track density to increase. several disk modes may get excited by windage pressure fluctuations acting on their surfaces. lower order modes occurring at lower frequencies may result in larger motions that adversely impact the servo system & # 39 ; s ability to track. some disk modes may be referred to as 0, 0 mode ( also known as the umbrella mode ) and 0, 1 mode ( also known as the tilting mode ). in the umbrella mode, the disks become umbrella - shaped, for example due to windage, and in the tilting mode the disks on the opposite sides of the disk outer edge move in the axial direction out of phase with one another. in other words, in tilting mode the outer edges of the disks on each side move in opposite directions, which is modulated by the rotational speed and manifested in two vibration modes. referring now to fig1, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor is shown, in which embodiments can be implemented. the fluid dynamic motor 100 includes a sleeve 110, a hub 120, a base 130, a shaft 140, magnets 150, and a stator 160. axial direction 101 shows a centerline axis. data storage disks ( not shown ) may be rotated at high speeds during operation using the magnets 150 and the stator 160. magnets 150 may be mounted on the hub 120 and may interact with the stator 160 to cause rotation of the hub 120 relative to the stator 160. the magnets 150 may be magnetized to form two or more magnetic poles. the fluid dynamic bearing motor 100 includes stationary component ( s ) as well as rotatable component ( s ) that define a fluid dynamic journal bearing and a thrust bearing therebetween. the rotatable component may include the hub portion 120 and the shaft 140 while the stationary component may include the sleeve 110. for example, the hub 120 and shaft 140 may be coupled with one another to form a single unitary piece, such that they rotate together about the centerline axis 101. alternatively, the hub 120 and the shaft 140 may be originally formed from a single piece of material. the interface between the shaft 140 and the sleeve 110 may define the fluid dynamic journal bearing while the interface between the hub 120 and the sleeve 110 may define the thrust bearing. it is appreciated that the rotatable component may be the sleeve 110 while the stationary components may include the hub 120 and the shaft 140. the sleeve 110, the hub 120, the shaft 140, the magnets 150, and the stator 160 are coupled to and housed in the base 130. the disks are supported on a hub and their rotation is supported by the fluid dynamic bearing to dampen axial and tilting motions. in other words, the axial and tilting motions of disk modes may transfer energy to the supporting motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing. the axial and tilting motions may be exacerbated in systems with more than one disk, for example from windage pushing and pulling on the upper and lower surfaces of the disks at the same time. in order for dampening to occur, the axial and tilting motions of the individual disks should cause axial, radial, or tilting of the hub 120 and shaft 140 with respect to the sleeve 110. accordingly, some of the kinetic energy is dissipated in the bearing and transformed into heat. however, higher order disk vibration modes in multi - disk system may cancel each other out. the cancelation occurs if the vibration modes are substantially identical in frequency and amplitude but of opposite direction. in other words the cancelation causes substantially a net zero relative motion between hub and shaft with respect to sleeve. with substantially net zero relative motion, the bearing may not dampen the disks vibration modes. for example, trapped air between the disks undergoes pressure fluctuations and forces the disks to move in unison but in opposite directions. accordingly, the deflection force couples within the hub and not through the fluid dynamic bearing as intended. thus, the disk vibration resulting from the axial and tilting movements is not dampened. in other words, higher order disk vibration modes couple directly to the spindle hub, bypassing the fluid dynamic bearing, thereby increasing the likelihood of read / write errors. referring now to fig2, effect of windage on the disks coupled to the fluid dynamic motor with a spacer is shown, in accordance with one embodiment. the fluid dynamic motor 100 may be coupled to an upper disk 210 and a lower disk 220. the fluid dynamic motor 100 may include a spacer ring 201 that is coupled to the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 and is further coupled to the hub 120. it is appreciated that showing of only an upper and a lower disk is for illustration purposes only and not intended to limit the scope. for example, three or more disks may be coupled to the fluid dynamic motor. in this example, a tilting mode is illustrated caused by the windage force. as described above, disk rotation at high frequencies, e. g., between 1000 hz to 5000 hz, may cause the upper disk 210 outer edges to move in opposite directions. similarly, disk rotation at high frequencies may cause the lower disk 220 outer edges to move in opposite directions. it is noteworthy that the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 move in opposite directions of one another. as such, the fluid dynamic bearing is bypassed if unaddressed. it is appreciated that at the umbrella mode, the upper disk 210 outer edges may move in the same direction, e. g., move up, while the lower disk 220 outer edges may move in the opposite direction of the upper disk 210 outer edges, hence move down in this instance. as such, at the umbrella mode the fluid dynamic bearing is also bypassed if unaddressed and may result in read / write errors. embodiments of the present invention implement a structure by which axial movement of disks in unison is reduced, thereby attenuating the disk resonances and dampening axial and tilting motions. accordingly, disk densities may safely be increased without increasing read / write errors. referring now to fig3, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with tapered ring spacer in accordance with one embodiment is shown. it is appreciated that components that are the same and operate the same as those in the previous figures are numbered with the same element number and their description is not duplicated at each subsequent figure. the fluid dynamic motor 300 according to one embodiment includes a spacer ring 310. the spacer ring 310 is tapered and couples to the hub 120. the spacer ring 310 is also connected to the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220. having a tapered ring 310 causes the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 to deflect at different radia resulting in disk vibration modes that are different. therefore, windage excitation may move the upper and the lower disks independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting or axial motions may be dissipated in the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing, resulting in dampening, because the tilting or axial motions by the upper 210 and lower disks 220 do not cancel each other out. in other words, having a tapered spacer ring 310 changes the boundary conditions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby shifting the natural frequencies of the upper 210 and lower disk 220 apart such that they vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, whether due to windage or some other force, do not occur in unison. in other words, shaping the spacer ring 310 such that the outer edge contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 220 effectively changes the diameter of the upper 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby reducing their tendency to move in opposite directions at the same time. referring now to fig4, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with different spacer chamfers in accordance with one embodiment is shown. the fluid dynamic motor 400 includes a spacer ring 410. the spacer ring 410 is coupled to the hub 120 and further connected to the upper 210 and the lower disk 220. the spacer ring 410 has an upper chamfer 412 that is sized differently than the lower chamfer 414. having a spacer ring 410 with its chamfers sized differently causes the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 to deflect independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting or axial motions by the upper 210 and lower disks 220 do not cancel each other. accordingly, having different spacer chamfers for a spacer ring 410 changes the boundary conditions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby shifting the natural frequencies of the upper 210 and lower disk 220 apart such that they vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, whether due to windage or other influence, do not occur in unison. in other words, shaping the spacer ring such that the outer edge contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 220 effectively changes the diameter of the upper 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby reducing their tendency to uniformly move in opposite directions. referring now to fig5, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with a lobed ring spacer in accordance with one embodiment is shown. the fluid dynamic motor 500 includes a spacer ring 510. the spacer ring 510 is coupled to the hub 120 and further connected to the upper 210 and the lower disk 220. the spacer ring 510 is lobed. having a lobed spacer ring 510 causes the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 to deflect independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 210 and lower disks 220 do not cancel each other. in other words, the lobed spacer ring 510 changes the boundary conditions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby shifting the natural frequencies of the upper 210 and lower disk 220 apart such that they vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, whether due to windage or not, do not occur in unison. the lobed spacer ring 510 contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 220 and effectively changes the diameter of the upper 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby reducing their tendency to move in opposite directions in unison. it is appreciated that the spacer ring may have any shape as long as the spacer contacts the upper disk at a different location in comparison to the lower disk. for example, referring now to fig6, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with a knee shaped ring spacer in accordance with one embodiment is shown. the fluid dynamic motor 600 may include a spacer ring 610. the spacer ring 610 is coupled to the hub 120 and is further coupled to the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220. the spacer ring 610 may be knee shaped such that it contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 220. having a knee shaped spacer ring 610 causes the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 to deflect independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 210 and lower disks 220 do not cancel each other. in other words, the knee shaped spacer ring 610 changes the boundary conditions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby shifting the natural frequencies of the upper 210 and lower disk 220 apart such that they vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, whether due to windage or not, do not occur in unison. the knee shaped spacer ring 610 contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 220 and effectively changes the diameter of the upper 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby reducing their tendency to move in opposite directions in unison. it is appreciated that the spacer ring shapes described herein are exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the embodiments. for example, the upper portion of the ring spacer may have a non - uniform diameter and the lower portion of the ring spacer may have a uniform diameter. referring now to fig7, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with two spacer rings in accordance with one embodiment is shown. the fluid dynamic motor 700 according to one embodiment includes an upper spacer ring 710 and a lower spacer ring 720. the upper spacer ring 710 is coupled to the upper disk 210 and is further coupled to the hub 120. the lower spacer ring 720 is coupled to the lower disk 220 and is further coupled to the hub 120. it is appreciated that the upper spacer ring 710 contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the lower spacer ring 720 and that the two spacer rings are separated from one another. having two spacer rings 710 and 720 contacting their respective disks in different locations cause the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220 to deflect independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 210 and lower disks 220 do not cancel each other. accordingly, having an upper spacer ring 710 and a lower spacer ring 720 contacting their respective disks in different locations change the boundary conditions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220. as such, the natural frequencies of the upper 210 and lower disk 220 are shifted apart and the disks vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 210 and the lower disk 220, whether due to windage or not, do not occur in unison. in other words, having two spacer rings shaped such that the outer edge of the upper spacer ring 710 contacts the upper disk 210 at a different location in comparison to the point of contact between the lower spacer ring 720 and lower disk 220 effectively changes the diameter of the upper 210 and the lower disk 220, thereby reducing their tendency to move in opposite directions in unison. referring now to fig8, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with different disk diameters in accordance with one embodiment. in this embodiment, the fluid dynamic motor 800 includes an upper disk 810 that has a different diameter than the lower disk 820. furthermore, the fluid dynamic motor 800 may include one or more spacers in accordance with one of the embodiments described above. for example, in this embodiment, the fluid dynamic motor 800 includes a lobed spacer 510. but it is appreciated that the spacer ring may be according to any of the spacers described above, e. g., tapered spacer, different spacer chamfers, etc. different diameters for the upper disk 810 and the lower disk 820 cause the upper disk 810 and the lower disk 820 to deflect independently and not in unison. moreover, having a ring spacer that contacts the upper disk 810 and the lower disk 820 at different locations may further help the disks deflect independently and not in unison. accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 810 and lower disks 820 do not cancel each other. in other words, the differently sized disks change the boundary conditions of the upper disk 810 and the lower disk 820, thereby shifting the natural frequencies of the upper 810 and lower disk 820 apart such that they vibrate out of phase. as such, tilting and / or axial motions of the upper disk 810 and the lower disk 820, whether due to windage or not, do not occur in unison. further, addition of a spacer ring contacting the upper disk 810 at a different location in comparison to the lower disk 820 further changes the effective diameter of the upper 810 and the lower disk 820, thereby reducing their tendency to move in opposite directions in unison. referring now to fig9, a cross sectional view of a fluid dynamic motor with different disk thickness in accordance with one embodiment is shown. the fluid dynamic motor 900 includes an upper disk 910 and a lower disk 920 that have different thicknesses. for example, the upper disk 910 is thinner in comparison to the lower disk 920. different thickness for the disks causes the natural frequencies of the upper disk 910 to separate from the lower disk 920, which causes them to deflect independent from one another and not to move in unison. as such, the disks couple through the fluid dynamic bearing that dampens the motion in axial and / or tilting directions. it is appreciated that a spacer ring making contact with the upper disk 910 and the lower disk 920 at different locations may further exacerbate independent movements of the upper and the lower disks. it is appreciated that the spacer ring may be in accordance with any of the embodiments described above ( in this example, the spacer ring is lobed ). accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 910 and lower disks 920 do not cancel each other. it is further appreciated that independent movements of the upper 1010 and the lower disk 1020 may further be exacerbated by having the upper and the lower disks with different diameters, as shown in fig1. as shown by the fluid dynamic bearing 1000, the upper disk 1010 has a different diameter in comparison to the lower disk 1020. in this embodiment, the lower disk 1020 has a thickness that is greater than the thickness of the upper disk 1010. however, it is appreciated that their respective thicknesses may be the same and having different thicknesses is merely exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. moreover, it is appreciated that the ring spacer may be in accordance with any of the embodiments described above ( in this example, the spacer ring is lobed ). however, it is appreciated that other embodiments may not require a ring spacer since the diameter of the upper and the lower disks are different. accordingly, energy from tilting and / or axial motions are transferred to the motor & # 39 ; s fluid dynamic bearing because the tilting and / or axial motions by the upper 1010 and lower disks 1020 do not cancel each other. it is appreciated that different materials may be used to vary the density and the elasticity of each disk to ensure that the disks do not move in unison. for example, different types of glass, polycarbonate plastic, aluminum, protective acrylic coating, etc., may be used for the upper disk than from the lower disk. the embodiments described above may be combined in any fashion, as desired. for example, any combination of the ring spacers ( described above ), with different diameters for the disks, with different thicknesses for different disks, different material for the disks, etc., may be used to ensure that the disks do not move in unison and to ensure transfer of energy to the fluid dynamic bearing. referring now to fig1 a and 11b, a comparison of the vibration measurement between a system without spacers and an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. fig1 a illustrates vibration measurement when the top and the bottom disks have the same thickness. as can be seen, high vibrations are measured for the tilting and the umbrella modes illustrated by 0, 0 and 0, 1 mode for frequencies over a 1000 hz. however, lower vibration measurements are registered for tilting and the umbrella modes for the top and the bottom disks having different thicknesses, as shown by fig1 b. in other words, a fluid dynamic motor in accordance with embodiments herein transfer the tilting and / or axial motions of the disks to the fluid dynamic bearing, thereby dampening the motions. as such, the disk density may be increased. the foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. however, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings.","an apparatus includes a hub , a first disk , a second disk , and a spacer . the hub is supported for relative rotation about a stationary component . the first disk is mounted to the hub with a first dynamic resonance mode associated therewith . the second disk is mounted to the hub with a second dynamic resonance mode associated therewith . the spacer is positioned between the first disk and the second disk , wherein the spacer is operable to cause the first dynamic resonance mode to be different from the second dynamic resonance mode ."
"preferred embodiment methods provide for distribution of items, such as blocks of identification numbers, for programming integrated circuits as part of circuit testing. fig1 illustrates a simple system of two sites with two automated testers at each site with each tester running various test software ( e. g., tester automation and data collection tools ) ; the testers blow electrical fuses to program a circuit. the preferred embodiments extend the tester software to provide automatic distribution of programming items from a master database through site operational databases to each tester as needed while maintaining tester throughput and limiting item inaccuracies. a first preferred embodiment method provides distribution of identification numbers ( ids ) used in the bluetooth wireless standard plus additional items, such as customer identifications and encryption keys, for an integrated circuit manufacturer which makes multiple products for various customers and, additionally, has contracted some work out to one or more foundries. each pertinent site has multiple ( e. g., 100 ) automatic testers for electrically testing each circuit ( still in wafer form or already packaged ), and these testers are also capable of electrically blowing fuses in circuits under test to program various items, from ids to activation of redundant circuitry, during the testing. the contract foundries would have similar setups. each tester runs various software tools ( e. g., tester automation and data collection ) so its operator can set the tester to automatically test each circuit, record test results, program ( blow fuses ) ids for circuits which had tested as good, and so forth. fig1 illustrates a system where each tester at a site communicates with an operational database for the site. the tester downloads from the operational database blocks of bluetooth ids if bluetooth circuits are under test, and customer identifications or other keys such as for des, rc4,. . . encryption if circuits requiring these are under test. conversely, the tester uploads to the operational database test results and requests for items being programmed into the circuits under test. for bluetooth ids every circuit requires a unique id ; whereas, for customer identification, the programmed item may be the same for all circuits within a lot ( e. g., 24 wafers with 500 circuits per wafer may require a single customer identification but 12000 bluetooth ids ). the preferred embodiments have a tester download bluetooth ids in blocks of size 128. any unused bluetooth ids at the end of a lot are simply discarded. the small size of the blocks in the tester implies little cost to discarding unused bluetooth ids. the operational database for a site ( including a foundry & # 39 ; s site ) acquires bluetooth ids from a master database in blocks of size 128k. and the master database has bluetooth ids stored in blocks of size 1m ; see fig1. the preferred embodiment methods may waste bluetooth ids if the key handler task is shut down. however, by not recycling unused ids from the tester level, this allows for a robust system which will minimize the chance of duplicate ids being used for two different circuits. the system of fig1 operates as follows. an ic manufacturer acquires a block of 1m bluetooth ids or customer keys. a web interface is used by an engineer of ( a business unit of ) the ic manufacturer to input bluetooth ids or customer keys to the master database. in the case of bluetooth, each id has 48 bits or, equivalently, 12 hexadecimal digits. as an example, presume the block of acquired ids consists of the range from 0x0800e7300000 to 0x0800e73fffff. the ids are stored in blocks of size 128k ( 0x20000 ), that is, storing 1m ids would add just the 8 entries 0x0800e7300000, 0x0800e7320000, 0x0800e7340000,. . . , 0x0800e73c0000, 0x0800e73e0000 to the inventory of the master database. the master database is connected to the operational databases of the various testing sites ( using local / wide area network or vpn ) of the ic manufacturer ( and any contract foundries ) plus the manufacturer & # 39 ; s it systems which include entry points for the acquired ids. next, an operational database at a testing site pulls one 128k block of ids from the master database, and the corresponding entry ( e. g., 0x0800e7340000 ) in the master database inventory is updated as allocated to the operational database which requested it. this pulling of a 128k block can be triggered by the inventory of available ids at the operational database dropping to near - empty ( low water mark ). the operational database divides the block of 128k ids into blocks of size 128 ( 0x80 ). thus the inventory addition from the 128k block would initially be 0x0800e7340000, 0x0800e7340080, 0x0800e7340100,. . . , 0x0800e735ff80 ; a total of 1k entries. the site operational database is locally connected to the site testers, and the individual testers will pull a block of 128 ids from the operational database as needed. this hierarchical id storage has the following benefits : further minimizes the chance that an id will be used twice. allows histories of the used ids to be kept for a longer time period. the distribution of customer keys, such as customer identification, encryption keys, and so forth can likewise be distributed with a master database, site operational databases, and the testers programming the information. the following section has implementation details for a typical system. the web interface could be an application that can be accessed by anyone entering a valid user identification and password. in order to update the values in the bluetooth table or the customer key table, the user identification must be in a list of authorized users. the web form will enable a business unit engineer to load new bluetooth ids and customer / device - specific public and private keys, and to view current key status ( e. g., available / allocated ). bluetooth ids are entered in a range, same as that given by the ieee : for example ids in the range 080028800000 - 080288fffff. bluetooth ids are stored in blocks of 128k ( 0x20000 ). only the beginning block address is stored in the master database. the web interface tool will verify that ids being entered do not duplicate ids already stored in the master database. it will also verify that the range of ids being entered is evenly divisible by 0x20000. customer ids, public keys and other key types can be loaded and / or modified using the web interface tool. public keys are encrypted by the tool before they are stored in the master database. the low water mark for bluetooth ids is set by the user using the web interface. when this mark is reached, the master database notifies the escalation list that ids are running low and need to be replenished. one week leadtime is typically needed for getting additional ids from the ieee, so the low water mark should be set accordingly. the master database holds bluetooth ids in blocks of 128k. the operational database pulls one or more blocks from the master database whenever a low water mark is reached. the operational database breaks up one 128k block into smaller blocks of 128 ids. the operational database will tell the master database which site pulled the ids for tracking purposes and keep them in a history table. customer keys are automatically pulled from the master database when requested ; no push operation from the master database is required. if a new customer key is entered into the master database, it will be allocated to a local operational database when a tester requests it. a stored procedure on the operational database is used by the key handler ( from a tester, see below ) to grab the starting address of a block of 128 bluetooth ids. this stored procedure updates the table containing available ids. it will also update a history table to show which testers are being allocated the ids. a table - level lock is made when a block is requested, guaranteeing that multiple key handlers hitting the same table will not get a duplicate block of ids. tables for the master database include a table for authorized users, a table for available and allocated bluetooth ids and a table for current customer keys. the bluetooth id tables : the tables for the operational database include a table for available bluetooth ids, a table for allocated bluetooth ids and a table for current customer keys. a stored procedure allows the key handler task to easily pull one block of bluetooth ids ; the procedure will take care of locking the available table, getting the next id, and then it to the allocated table. key handler is a daemon task running a tester. key handler will not connect to the operational database or grab any bluetooth ids until the first request by the test program. key handler connects and disconnects to the operational database as needed. it does not remain connected while in an idle state. the test program can request one or more bluetooth ids, which key handler requests from the operational database and returns to test program. key handler will pull one block of 128 ids from the operational database and keep it as cache. this way the test program can request one id at a time without having the key handler hit the operational database every time. also, the ids are not recycled ( unused ids are not returned to the operational database ), so uniqueness is guaranteed at the expense of discarding unused ids in the blocks of 128. if a customer public key is requested by the test program, the key handler will get it from the operational database, decrypt it, and then pass it back to the test program. the test program talks to the key handler task through a pair of named pipes or through a socket using a predefined set of ascii messages. for example, the pipe names could be / tmp / twkey _ in for the input pipe to send messages to the key handler and / tmp / twkey _ out for the output pipe to receive messages from the key handler. a predefined set of messages types are available. key _ request message : get a key from a particular key type ( public key, customer id, etc. ) and a key id ( device name, system item id, etc. ) ; and bt _ request message : get one or more bluetooth ids. all messages to key handler are responded to with an acknowledge ack or a not acknowledge nak, along with additional information. note that in ascii ack is taken to be 0x06 and nak is 0x15. a nak response message will include a reason. for example, the response could be one of : if a bluetooth id is needed, the test program can request one id, which key handler will return to it. the test program can also request a number of ids, such as a full block of 128, which the key handler will return to it as a range. if a customer key is needed, the test program will request it by a key _ type = customer _ key and a key _ id, which the key handler will request from the operational database and return to the test program. the customer key is the same for all circuits in a lot, so the test program will only need to request it once at the beginning of the lot. if a public key is needed ( or any other key that is encrypted in the operational database ), the key handler will decrypt it before giving it to the test program. if the key handler cannot get the required number of bluetooth ids or a customer key, it will return a nak to the test program. the preferred embodiments may be varied while retaining the hierarchical distribution feature. for example, the block sizes in the master database, operational databases, and testers could be varied such as block sizes 64 or 256 in a tester, 64k or 256k in an operational database, and so forth.","the distribution of bluetooth ids among multiple integrated circuit testers at multiple sites for programming with a master database containing large size id blocks , site operational databases with medium size id blocks and tester programs with small size id blocks provides reduced memory requirements and limits the chance of two units with a duplicate id ."
"fig1 shows a top view of a stage mechanism in accordance with the present invention. see also commonly owned and invented u. s. pat. no. 5, 528, 118 entitled & # 34 ; guideless stage with isolated reaction stage & # 34 ; which is incorporated herein by reference and shows a related method of supporting elements of a stage mechanism so as to isolate reaction forces from the projection lens and other parts of a photolithography apparatus. the stage 10 is ( in plan view ) a rectangular structure of a rigid material ( e. g., steel, aluminum, or ceramic ). two interferometry mirrors 14a and 14b located on stage 10 interact conventionally with respectively laser beams 16a and 16b. conventionally, laser beams 16a are two pairs of laser beams and laser beams 16b are one pair of laser beam, for three independent distance measurements. the underside of stage 10 defines a relieved portion 22 ( indicated by a dotted line, not being visible in the plane of the drawing ). a reticle 24 is located on stage 10 and held by conventional reticle vacuum groove 26 formed in the upper surface of chuck plate 28. stage 10 also defines a central aperture 30 ( passage ) below the location of reticle 24. central aperture 30 allows the light ( or other ) beam which penetrates through reticle 24 to enter the underlying projection lens, as described further below. ( it is to be understood that the reticle 24 itself is not a part of the stage mechanism. ) moreover if the present stage mechanism is to be used for other than a reticle stage, i. e. for supporting a wafer, aperture 30 is not needed. stage 10 is supported on a conventional rectangular base structure 32 of e. g. granite, steel, or aluminum, and having a smooth planar upper surface. the left and right edges ( in fig1 ) of base structure 32 are shown as dotted lines, being overlain by other structures ( as described below ) in this view. in operation, stage 10 is not in direct physical contact with its base structure 32 ; instead, stage 10 is vertically supported by, in this example, conventional bearings such as gas bearings. in one embodiment three air bearings 36a, 36b and 36c are used which may be of a type commercially available. in an alternative air bearing / vacuum structure, the vacuum portion is physically separated from and adjacent to the air bearing portion. it is to be understood that the vacuum and compressed air are provided externally via tubing in a conventional cable bundle and internal tubing distribution system ( not shown in the drawings for simplicity ). in operation stage 10 thereby floats on the air bearings 36a, 36b, 36c approximately 1 to 3 micrometers above the flat top surface of base structure 32. it is to be understood that other types of bearings ( e. g. air bearing / magnetic combination type ) may be used alternatively. stage 10 is laterally surrounded by the & # 34 ; window frame guide & # 34 ; which is a four member rectangular structure. the four members as shown in fig1 are ( in the drawing ) the top member 40a, the bottom member 40b, the lefthand member 40c, and the righthand member 40d. the four members 40a - 40d are of any material having high specific stiffness ( stiffness to density ratio ) such as aluminum or a composite material. these four members 40a - 40d are attached together by hinge structures which allow non - rigid movement of the four members relative to one another in the x - y plane and about the z - axis as shown in the drawing, this movement also referred to as a & # 34 ; yaw & # 34 ; movement. the hinge is described in detail below, each hinge 44a, 44b, 44c and 44d being e. g. one or more metal flexures allowing a slight flexing of the window frame guide structure. the window frame guide structure moves in the x axis ( to the left and right in fig1 ) supported on horizontal surfaces of fixed guides 46a and 46b, and supported on vertical surfaces of fixed guides 64a, 64b. ( it is to be understood that each pair of fixed guides 46a, 64a and 46b, 64b could be e. g. a single l - shaped fixed guide, or other configurations of fixed guides may be used. ) mounted on window frame guide member 40a are two air bearings 50a and 50b that cause the member 40a to ride on its supporting fixed guide member 46a. similarly air bearings 52a and 52b are mounted on the member 40b, allowing member 40b to ride on its supporting fixed guide member 46b. air bearings 50a, 50b, 52a, 52b are similar to air bearings 36a, etc. the window frame guide is driven along the x axis on fixed guides 46a and 46b, 64a and 64b by a conventional linear motor, which includes a coil 60a which is mounted on window frame guide member 40a. motor coil 60a moves in a magnetic track 62a which is located in ( or along ) fixed guide 64a. similarly, motor coil 60b which is mounted on window frame guide member 40b moves in magnetic track 62b which is located in fixed guide 64b. the motor coil and track combinations are part no. lm - 310 from trilogy company of webster tex. these motors are also called & # 34 ; linear commutator motors & # 34 ;. the tracks 62a, 62b are each a number of permanent magnets fastened together. the electric wires which connect to the motor coils are not shown but are conventional. other types of linear motors may be substituted. it is to be understood that the locations of the motor coils and magnetic tracks for each motor could be reversed, so that for instance the magnetic tracks are located on stage 10 and the corresponding motor coils on the window frame guide members, at a penalty of reduced performance. similarly, stage 10 moves along the y axis in fig1 by means of motor coils 68a and 68b mounted respectively on the left and right edges of stage 10. motor coil 68a moves in magnetic track 70a mounted in window frame guide member 40c. motor coil 68b moves in magnetic track 70b mounted in window frame guide member 40d. also shown in fig1 are air bearings 72a, 72b and 72c. air bearing 72a is located on window frame guide member 40a and minimizes friction between window frame guide member 40a and its fixed guide 64a. similarly two air bearings 72b and 72c on window frame guide member 40b minimize its friction with the fixed guide 64b. the use of a single air bearing 72a at one end and two opposing air bearings 72b and 72c at the other end allows a certain amount of yaw ( rotation in the x - y plane about the z - axis ) as well as limited motion along the z - axis. in this case, typically air bearing 72a is gimbal mounted, or gimbal mounted with the gimbal located on a flexure so as to allow a limited amount of misalignment between the member 40a and fixed guide 64a. the use of the air bearing 72a opposing bearings 72b and 72c provides a loading effect to keep the window frame guide in its proper relationship to fixed guides 64a, 64b. similarly, an air bearing 76a loads opposing air bearings 76b and 76c, all mounted on side surfaces of the stage 10, in maintaining the proper location of stage 10 relative to the opposing window frame guide members 40b and 40d. again, in this case one air bearing such as 76a is gimbal mounted to provide a limited amount of misalignment, or gimbal mounted with the gimbal on a flexure ( spring ). air bearings 72a, 72b, 72c and 76a, 76b, and 76c are conventional air bearings. the outer structure 80 in fig1 is the base support structure for the fixed guides 46a, 46b, 64a, 64b and the window frame guide members 40a,. . . , 40d of the stage mechanism, but does not support stage base structure 32. thus the underlying support is partitioned so the reaction force on base support structure 80 does not couple into the stage base structure 32. base support structure 80 is supported by its own support pillars or other conventional support elements ( not shown in this drawing ) to the ground, i. e. the surface of the earth or the floor of a building. an example of a suitable support structure is disclosed in above - referenced u. s. patent application ser. no. 08 / 221, 375 at fig1 b, 1c. this independent support structure for this portion of stage mechanism provides the above - described advantage of transmitting the reaction forces of the reticle stage mechanism drive motors away from the frame supporting the other elements of the photolithography apparatus, especially away from the optical elements including the projection lens and from the wafer stage, thereby minimizing vibration forces on the projection lens due to reticle stage movement. this is further described below. the drive forces for the stage mechanism are provided as close as possible through the stage mechanism center of gravity. as can be understood, the center of gravity of the stage mechanism moves with the stage 10. thus the stage 10 and the window frame guide combine to define a joint center of gravity. a first differential drive control ( not shown ) for motor coils 60a, 60b takes into account the location of the window frame guide to control the force exerted by each motor coil 60a, 60b to keep the effective force applied at the center of gravity. a second conventional differential drive control ( not shown ) for motor coils 68a, 68b takes into account the location of stage 10 to control the force exerted by each motor coil 68a, 68b to keep the effective force applied at the center of gravity. it is to be understood that since stage 10 has a substantial range of movement, that the differential drive for the motor coils 60a, 60b has a wide differential swing. in contrast, the window frame guide has no center gravity change, hence the differential drive for the motor coils 68a, 68b has a much lesser differential swing, providing a trim effect. advantageously, use of the window frame guide maintains the reaction forces generated by movement of the reticle stage mechanism in a single plane, thus making easier to isolate these forces from other parts of the photolithography apparatus. fig2 shows a cross - sectional view through line 2 - - 2 of fig1. the structures shown in fig2 which are also in fig1 have identical reference numbers and are not described herein. also shown in fig2 is the illuminator 90 which is a conventional element shown here without detail, and omitted from fig1 for clarity. also shown without detail in fig2 is the upper portion of the projection lens ( barrel ) 92. it is to be understood that the lower portion of the projection lens and other elements of the photolithography apparatus are not shown in fig2 but are illustrated and described below. the supporting structure 94 for the projection lens 92 is also shown in fig2. as can be seen, structure 94 is separated at all points by a slight gap 96 from the base support structure 80 for the reticle stage mechanism. this gap 96 isolates vibrations caused by movement of the reticle stage mechanism from the projection lens 92 and its support 94. as shown in fig2 stage 10 is not in this embodiment a flat structure but defines the underside relieved portion 22 to accommodate the upper portion of lens 92. magnetic track 70a is mounted on top of the window frame guide 40b and similarly magnetic track 70b is mounted on top of the opposite window frame guide member 40d. fig3 a and 3b are enlarged views of portions of fig2 with identical reference numbers ; fig3 a is the left side of fig2 and fig3 b is the right side of fig2. shown in fig3 a is the spring mounting 78 for air bearing 76a. air bearing 78a being spring mounted to a side surface of stage 10, this allows a certain amount of yaw ( rotation in the x - y plane about the z - axis ) as well as limited motion along the z - axis. a gimbal mounting may be used in place of or in addition to the spring 78. the spring or gimbal mounting thereby allows for a limited amount of misalignment between stage 10 and members 40c, 40d ( not shown in fig3 a ). fig4 is a top view of a photolithography apparatus including the stage mechanism of fig1 and 2 and further including, in addition to the elements shown in fig1 the supporting base structure 100 which supports the photolithography apparatus including frame 94 except for the reticle stage mechanism. ( not all the structures shown in fig1 are labelled in fig4 for simplicity. ) base structure 100 supports four vertical support pillars 102a, 102b, 102c and 102d connected to structure 94 by respectively bracket structures 106a, 106b, 106c and 106d. it is to be appreciated that the size of the base structure 100 is fairly large, i. e. approximately 3 meters top to bottom in one embodiment. each pillar 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d includes an internal conventional servo mechanism ( not shown ) for leveling purposes. also shown in fig4 are the supports 108 and 110 for respectively laser interferometer units ( beam splitter etc. ) 112a, 112b, 112c. fig4 will be further understood with reference to fig5 which shows a view of fig4 through cross - sectional line 5 - - 5 of fig4. in fig4 and 5 the full extent of the supporting structure 94 can be seen along with its support pillars 102a, 102c which rest on the base structure 100 which is in contact with the ground via a conventional foundation ( not shown ). the independent support structure for the reticle stage base support structure 80 is shown, in fig4 only ( for clarity ) and similarly includes a set of four pillars 114a, 114b, 114c, 114d with associated bracket structures 116a, 116b, 116c, 116d, with the pillars thereby extending from the level of base support structure 80 down to the base structure 100. the lower portion of fig5 shows the wafer stage 120 and associated support structures 122, 124. the elements of wafer stage 120 conventionally include ( not labelled in the drawing ) a base, the stage itself, fixed stage guides located on the base, magnetic tracks located on the fixed stage guides, and motor coils fitting in the magnetic tracks and connected to the stage itself. laser beams from laser 124 mounted on support 126 locate lens 92 and the stage itself by interferometry. fig6 a shows detail of one of the window frame guide hinged flexure structures, e. g. 44c, in a top view ( corresponding to fig1 ). each of hinges 44a, 44b, 44c and 44d is identical. these flexure hinges have the advantage over a mechanical - type hinge of not needing lubrication, not exhibiting histeresis ( as long as the flexure is not bent beyond its mechanical tolerance ) and not having any mechanical & # 34 ; slop & # 34 ;, as well as being inexpensive to fabricate. each individual flexure is e. g. 1 / 4 hard 302 stainless steel approximately 20 mils ( 0. 02 inch ) thick and can sustain a maximum bend of 0. 5 degree. the width of each flexure is not critical ; a typical width is 0. 5 inch. two, three or four flexures are used at each hinge 44a, 44b, 44c and 44d in fig1. the number of flexures used at each hinge is essentially determined by the amount of space available, i. e., the height of the window frame guide members. the four individual flexures 130a, 130b, 130c, 130d shown in fig6 a ( and also in a 90 rotated view in fig6 b ) are each attached by clamps 136a, 136b, 136c, 136d to adjacent frame members ( members 40b and 40d in fig6 a and 6b ) by conventional screws which pass through holes in the individual flexures 130a, 130b, 130c, 130d and through the clamps and are secured in corresponding threaded holes in frame members 40b and 40d. note that the frame members 40b, 40d of fig6 a and 6b differ somewhat from those of fig1 in terms of the angular ( triangular ) structures at the ends of frame members 40b, 40d and to which the metal flexures 130a, 130b, 130c, 130d are mounted. in the embodiment of fig1 these angular structures are dispensed with, although their presence makes screw mounting of the flexures easier. in an alternate embodiment, the window frame guide is not hinged but is a rigid structure. to accommodate this rigidity and prevent binding, one of bearings 72c or 72b is eliminated, and the remaining bearing moved to the center of member 40b, mounted on a gimbal with no spring. the other bearings ( except those mounted on stage 10 ) are also gimballed. this disclosure is illustrative and not limiting ; further modifications will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of this disclosure and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.","a guided stage mechanism suitable for supporting a reticle in a photolithography machine includes a stage movable in the x - y directions on a base . laterally surrounding the stage is a rectangular window frame guide which is driven in the x - axis direction on two fixed guides by means of motor coils on the window frame guide co - operating with magnetic tracks fixed on the base . the stage is driven inside the window frame guide in the y - axis direction by motor coils located on the stage co - operating with magnetic tracks located on the window frame guide . forces from the drive motors of both the window frame guide and the stage are transmitted through the center of gravity of the stage , thereby eliminating unwanted moments of inertia . additionally , reaction forces caused by the drive motors are isolated from the projection lens and the alignment portions of the photolithography machine . this isolation is accomplished by providing a mechanical support for the stage independent of the support for its window frame guide . the window frame guide is a hinged structure capable of a slight yawing motion due to hinged flexures which connect the window frame guide members ."
"fig1 schematically shows a prior art electrochemical sensor 100 comprising a first working electrode 101, a second working electrode 102, a reference electrode 103, and a common counter electrode 104. both working electrodes 101 and 102 share the same counter electrode 104 and the same reference electrode 103 and are exposed to the same electrolyte solution 111 from an electrolyte reservoir 110. over the first working electrode 101, a filter 121 for a specific target gas is arranged. this filter 121 effectively removes the target gas from an airflow. an air gap between the filter 121 and the first working electrode 101 is indicated at 123. over the second working electrode 102, a dummy filter structure 122 is arranged. this structure 122 has mechanical properties similar to filter 121, but does not filter out any of the air pollutants. an air gap between the dummy filter structure 122 and the second working electrode 102 is indicated at 124. insulators adjacent the working electrodes are indicated by reference numerals 140. an air - permeable sensor cover 130 covers the filter 121 and the dummy filter structure 122 and holds them in place. the gas to be monitored, for instance ambient air 150, slowly passes the cover 130 and the filter 121 or the dummy filter structure 122, respectively, to reach the first working electrode 101 or the second working electrode 102, respectively. thus, the first working electrode 101 is passively exposed to air from which the target pollutant has been removed, while the second working electrode 102 is passively exposed to unfiltered ambient air. if the two working electrodes 101, 102 have mutually equal characteristics, the difference between their output signals is proportional to the amount ( or concentration ) of target gas in the air. fig2 is a drawing schematically illustrating the basic principles behind the present invention. a gas sensing apparatus according to the present invention is generally indicated by reference numeral 1, and comprises a gas sensor 2 and a target gas filter 4. as long as it is sensitive to at least the target gas to be sensed, the gas sensor 2 may be any known sensor ; therefore a more detailed description of the gas sensor 2 is omitted here. it is noted that the gas sensor 2 as such does not need to have selectivity for the target gas. in fact, the gas sensor may be sensitive to various different target gases or classes of target gases. the apparatus 1 furthermore comprises controllable means capable of causing air 3, derived from polluted ambient air, to follow either one of at least two different airflow paths, as illustrated by two flow arrows 5 and 6. the concentration of the target gas in air 3 is substantially the same as in the ambient air from which air 3 is derived. in one airflow 5, the air 3 passes the target gas filter 4, so that the target gas is substantially removed from the air 3 before the air reaches the sensor 2. in another airflow 6, the air 3 does not pass the target gas filter 4, so that the airflow 6 reaching the sensor 2 has substantially the same concentration of target gas as the ambient air. the air 3 may be totally unfiltered ambient air, so that the composition of air 6 is substantially equal to the composition of ambient air. it is also possible that air 3 is derived from ambient air by passing the ambient air through a filter that removes one or more gas components but does not affect the concentration of the target gas. this means that both gas flows 5 and 6, when reaching the sensor 2, have the same composition as far as all other components are concerned, except for the target gas which is substantially absent in the first gas flow 5 and which is substantially present in the second gas flow 6 to the same extent as in the original ambient air. thus, the sensor is exposed either to air with or air without the target gas, all other components being the same, and any difference in the sensor output signal in these two situations is representative of the amount of target gas. several implementations are possible, as will be explained in the following. for allowing unfiltered ambient air 6 to reach the gas sensor 2, it may be sufficient to use ( natural ) convection as the driving force for air displacement, but it is also possible to use airflow generating means, for instance a ventilator or a pump. for making air pass the filter 4, convection will usually be insufficient to generate the airflow 5, so that the apparatus preferably comprises airflow generating means, for instance a ventilator, but it is also possible to connect the apparatus to a source of pressure difference. airflow selection in the gas sensing apparatus 1 can for instance be done by using controllable valves and / or controllable ventilators. a first embodiment of a gas sensing apparatus according to the present invention is generally indicated by reference numeral 200 and is schematically illustrated in fig3 a and 3b. the gas sensing apparatus 200 comprises a measuring chamber 210 and a gas sensor 220 arranged in the measuring chamber 210. the measuring chamber 210 has at least one passageway 211 allowing direct entry of ambient air and allowing this ambient air to reach the measuring chamber 210 unfiltered. in the embodiment shown, there are two different passageways 211, 212 connecting the measuring chamber 210 to the ambient environment such as to allow for convection. the gas sensing apparatus 200 further comprises an air duct 230 having an entrance 231 communicating with the ambient environment and an output 232 communicating with the measuring chamber 210. the gas sensing apparatus 200 further comprises a gas filter 234 and a controllable airflow generating means 233, for instance a ventilator, arranged in the air duct 230. the figure shows the gas filter 234 arranged between the entrance 231 and the ventilator 233, but this order may also be reversed. the filter 234 is selected for substantially removing the target gas to be sensed from any air passing the filter, and will also be indicated as target gas filter. the gas sensing apparatus 200 further comprises a control device 240 for controlling the ventilator 233, the control device 240 having a control output 243 coupled to a control input of the ventilator 233. the control device 240 may for instance be implemented as a suitably programmed microprocessor, microcontroller, or the like. the control device 240 in this embodiment is integrated with means for sensor signal evaluation, for which purpose the control device 240 is provided with a measuring input 241 connected to receive an output signal from the sensor 220. it is noted that the functionality of sensor signal evaluation may be implemented in a different unit, which then would have an output communicating with an input of the control device, so that control of the ventilator can take place on the basis of the outcome of the sensor signal evaluation. the gas sensing apparatus 200 is capable of operating in two different operational modes. in a first operational mode, the gas sensor 220 is exposed to unfiltered ambient air : this mode will hereinafter be indicated as unfiltered mode, and the measuring output signal of the sensor 220 in this mode will be indicated as smu. in a second operational mode, the gas sensor 220 is exposed to a flow of ambient air filtered by the filter 234 : this mode will hereinafter be indicated as filtered mode, and the measuring output signal of the sensor 220 in this mode will be indicated as smf. the control device 240 is capable of calculating a differential signal s = smu smf, which is proportional to the target gas concentration in the unfiltered ambient air. this differential signal s can be considered as constituting the measuring output signal of the sensing apparatus 200. it is noted that the tasks of receiving and processing the sensor output signals on the one hand and controlling the ventilator on the other hand may alternatively be performed by separate calculating / evaluating and control units. fig3 a illustrates the gas sensing apparatus 200 operating in its unfiltered mode. the ventilator 233 is off. convective flows of unfiltered ambient air 213, 214 reach the measuring chamber 210 through the passageways 211, 212. fig3 b illustrates the gas sensing apparatus 200 operating in its filtered mode. the ventilator 233 is on, causing a flow of ambient air 235 in the duct 230 to pass the filter 234 and reach the measuring chamber 210 as filtered air 237, leaving the measuring chamber 210 via passageway 212 which now acts as an output. preferably, the control device 240 switches the ventilator 233 on and off periodically, such as to periodically alternate between the filtered mode and the unfiltered mode. in the schematical layout of fig3 a and 3b, the first passageway 211 is shown between the duct 230 and the measuring chamber 210. in such a case, the design should be such that a portion 236 of the flow 235 generated in the duct 230 is blown out through the first passageway 211 in order to prevent unfiltered ambient air from reaching the measuring chamber 210. fig3 c illustrates a layout where this issue does hardly play a role. in the above, it has been mentioned that, in the unfiltered mode, unfiltered ambient air may reach the sensor convectively, i. e. with the ventilator off. alternatively, it is possible that the gas sensing apparatus 200 comprises a second ventilator for, in the unfiltered mode, causing a flow of unfiltered ambient air to enter the measuring chamber 210 through one passageway 211 and leave the measuring chamber through the other passageway 212, or vice versa. in the above, switching between the filtered operational mode and the unfiltered operational mode is done by switching the ventilator 233 on or off. it is also possible to obtain such switching by selectively operating the ventilator 233 in one direction or an opposite direction, as illustrated in fig4. the duct 230 is shown to have two input / output openings 231, 232 with the sensor 220, ventilator 233 and filter 234 being arranged between said openings. in the upper half of the figure, the ventilator 233 is operated to generate an airflow from the right to the left, so that the sensor 220 is upstream of the filter 234 : the airflow reaches the sensor 220 before reaching the filter 234. this is the unfiltered mode, wherein the sensor 220 is exposed to unfiltered air and outputs the unfiltered output signal smu. in the lower half of the figure, the ventilator 233 is operated to generate an airflow from the left to the right, so that the sensor 220 is downstream of the filter 234 : the airflow reaches the filter 234 before reaching the sensor 220. this is the filtered mode, wherein the sensor 220 is exposed to filtered air and outputs the filtered output signal smf. it is noted that the relative position of the ventilator 233 is not essential : it may be located between opening 231 and the filter 234, between opening 232 and the sensor 220, or between filter 234 and sensor 220. it is further noted that, instead of a bi - directional ventilator, two mono - directional ventilators can be used, arranged in mutually opposite orientation. in a further elaboration, illustrated in fig5, apparatus 300 has two different filters 234 and 334 arranged on opposite sides of the sensor 220. again, the relative position of the ventilator 233 is not essential. the second filter 334 has filtering characteristics differing from the first filter 234 in that it does not filter the target gas. more particularly, the second filter 334 is capable of filtering a specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, and the first filter 234 is capable of filtering the same specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, respectively, as well as the target gas. in the lower half of fig5, the situation is equivalent to the situation of fig4 ( lower half ) : the second filter 334 is downstream of the sensor 220 and has no influence on the sensor output signal smf 1. in the upper half of the figure, with the reverse flow direction, the second filter 334 is upstream of the sensor 220, so that the airflow reaches the second filter 334 before reaching the sensor 220 ; the sensor output signal in this case is indicated as smf 2. in both cases, the sensor 220 is exposed to filtered gas. in both cases, said specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, respectively, has been removed from the original ambient gas. in the case of the lower half of the figure, with the first filter 234 upstream of the sensor 220, also the target gas has been removed. consequently, a difference signal s = smf 2 smf 1 is proportional to the target gas concentration in the filtered gas and therefore proportional to the target gas concentration in the unfiltered ambient gas. this embodiment is advantageous in cases where it is desirable to protect the sensor 220 against the influence of certain gases. in a further elaboration, illustrated in fig6, the duct 230 of apparatus 400 has one or more openings 401 allowing ambient gas 403 to directly reach the sensor 220 without being filtered. the one or more openings 401 is / are provided with controllable closure means 402 controlled by the control device 240 at its output 242. with the controllable closure means 402 in the closed state, the situation is basically identical to the situation of apparatus 300 in fig5 and the target gas concentration can be inferred from the signal difference s = smf 2 smf 1. the control device 240 now has the additional option of switching the ventilator 233 off and opening the closure means 402 in order to allow ambient gas 403 to directly reach the sensor 220, for instance through convection. the sensor 220 now provides a measuring signal smu derived from unfiltered ambient gas, and it is possible to calculate a difference signal s = smu smf 2 proportional to the concentration of said specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, respectively. in other words, apparatus 400 is selective to two different gases or two different groups of gases independently of each other, and these can be inferred by the apparatus 400 from the signal differences s = smf 2 smf 1 and s = smu smf 2, respectively. it will be clear that in this embodiment the gas sensor 220 should have sufficient sensitivity to both different gases or to both different groups of gases in order to achieve selectivity to both different gases or to both different groups of gases, independently of each other, at the respective concentrations thereof in the ambient air. in a further elaboration, illustrated in fig7, the apparatus 400 has a series arrangement of first filter 234 and first ventilator 233 arranged on one side of the sensor 220, wherein the relative order of the first filter 234 and first ventilator 233 is not essential, and has a series arrangement of second filter 334 and a second ventilator 533 arranged on the opposite side of the sensor 220, wherein the relative order of the second filter 334 and second ventilator 533 is not essential. both ventilators may be bi - directional ventilators, but that is not essential. the control device 240 again has the option of switching off both ventilators 233, 533 : the situation then is equivalent to the situation of fig6, where ambient gas 403 is allowed to directly reach the sensor 220 through convection. the control device 240 now has the additional option of switching on both ventilators 233, 533 to generate a first forced airflow 404 from opening 401 towards first filter 234 and a second forced airflow 405 from opening 401 towards second filter 334. consequently, ambient gas is actively forced to pass the sensor 220, and the unfiltered measuring signal smu is obtained without being dependent on convection. with reference to fig5, it is noted that the first filtered output signal smf 1 can now be obtained by closing the closure means 402 and operating one or both ventilators 233, 533 to create an airflow from the left to the right in the figure, so that effectively the situation is equivalent to the situation of the lower half of fig5, and it is further noted that the second filtered output signal smf 2 can now be obtained by closing the closure means 402 and operating one or both ventilators 233, 533 to create an airflow from the right to the left in the figure, so that effectively the situation is equivalent to the situation of the upper half of fig5. alternatively, however, it is possible to obtain the first filtered output signal smf 1 by opening the closure means 402, switching off the second ventilator 533 and operating the first ventilator 233 to create an airflow from the left to the right in the figure, exiting via the opening 401, and it is possible to obtain the second filtered output signal smf 2 by opening the closure means 402, switching off the first ventilator 233 and operating the second ventilator 533 to create an airflow from the right to the left in the figure, exiting via the opening 401. in the above description with reference to fig4 - 7, the sensor 220 is described as being arranged in a duct 230 having input / output openings 231, 232 at opposite sides of the sensor. however, with reference to fig3 a - d, it is also possible to describe such an arrangement as being a combination of two ducts, each having one input / output opening communicating with the ambient atmosphere and an opposite input / output opening communicating with a location where the sensor is positioned, such a location being referred to as measuring chamber. in the following description with reference to fig8, the latter wording will be used for the sake of convenience. apparatus 600 of fig8 is a further elaboration of apparatus 500 of fig7, illustrating that it is possible to effectively have multiple apparatuses 500 sharing one common sensor 220 arranged in a measuring chamber 210. the figure shows an embodiment with six ducts 610 - 660, each duct having a first opening 611 - 661 communicating with the ambient atmosphere and an opposite opening 612 - 662 communicating with the measuring chamber 210. in each duct 610 - 660, a series arrangement of a filter 613 - 663 and a bi - directional ventilator 614 - 664 ( or other type of flow generator ) is arranged. the ventilators are controlled by a control device not shown in this figure for the sake of simplicity. with reference to fig6 and 7, it is noted that this apparatus 600 may also comprise an opening for allowing ambient gas to reach the measuring chamber 210, either through convection ( as in fig6 ) or through suction by operating all ventilators ( as in fig7 ). the six ducts 610 - 660 together define three pairs of ducts 610, 640 ; 620, 650 ; 630, 660. the ducts of each pair are arranged in such a way that their respective second openings 612, 642 ; 622, 652 ; 632, 662 are located on opposite sides of the measuring chamber 210. the control device is designed such as to selectively operate one of said pairs of ducts, with the other pairs being out of operation. then, such a selected pair of ducts behaves like the embodiment 300 discussed with reference to fig5. fig8 illustrates this for the ducts 610 and 640 : by appropriate control of the corresponding ventilators 614, 644, ambient air flows from opening 611 via measuring chamber 210 towards opening 641, as shown by arrows, or in the opposite direction, so the sensor 220 is exposed to air selectively filtered by either filter 613 or filter 643, respectively. likewise, the ducts 620 and 650 form an associated pair : by appropriate control of the corresponding ventilators 624, 654, ambient air flows from opening 621 via measuring chamber 210 towards opening 651, or in the opposite direction, so the sensor 220 is exposed to air selectively filtered by either filter 623 or filter 653, respectively. likewise, the ducts 630 and 660 form an associated pair : by appropriate control of the corresponding ventilators 634, 664, ambient air flows from opening 631 via measuring chamber 210 towards opening 661, or in the opposite direction, so the sensor 220 is exposed to air selectively filtered by either filter 633 or filter 663, respectively. it should be clear that the same type of operation applies if the number of such pairs is equal to 2 or equal to 4 or more. it is further noted that fig8 shows all the ducts as being in open communication with the ambient atmosphere. however, in order to avoid an undesired airflow through any of the inactive ducts, each duct is preferably equipped with a controllable closure device, for instance a valve, controlled by the control device, which controls the closure devices such that the closure devices of the inactive ducts are always closed and the closure devices of the active ducts are always open. in each pair of associated ducts ( for instance 610, 640 ), the corresponding pair of filters ( for instance 613, 643 ) is designed in the same way as in the apparatus 300 described with reference to fig5. thus, one filter of this pair of filters ( for instance 613 ) is capable of filtering a specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, and the other filter of this pair of filters ( for instance 643 ) is capable of filtering the same specific gas or group of gases or class of gases, respectively, as well as the target gas. when comparing different pairs of associated ducts with each other, the design of the corresponding pairs of filters differs because either the target gas of one pair of filters differs from the target gas of the other pair of filters, or the specific gas or group of gases or class of gases of one pair of filters differs from the specific gas or group of gases or class of gases of the other pair of filters, or both. thus, by suitable activation of the several ventilators, it is possible to obtain individual information on the concentration of multiple gases separately while using only one sensor, provided that the sensor has non - zero sensitivity towards each of the said multiple gases at their respective concentrations in the ambient air. in the apparatus 600 as illustrated in fig8, each duct is provided with an associated ventilator. selecting the path which the gas flow takes in the apparatus, and thus selecting which filter is upstream of the sensor, is done by suitable control of the ventilators. however, alternative embodiments having the same functionality may have fewer ventilators. fig9 illustrates an alternative apparatus 700 wherein each duct 610 - 660 is provided with a controllable closure device 615 - 665, for instance implemented as a shutter or a valve, controlled by the control device ( not shown in this figure ), such that the closure devices 625, 635, 655, 665 of the inactive ducts 620, 630, 650, 660 are always closed and the closure devices 615, 645 of the active ducts 610, 640 are always open. the apparatus 700 has a common duct 710 leading to / from the measuring chamber 210, and a ventilator 714 arranged in the common duct 710. in order to allow gas to flow in two opposite directions, the ventilator 714 may be a bi - directional ventilator, or it is possible to use a second ventilator 714, as shown. each duct in a pair of associated ducts is always coupled to one end or to the other end of the common duct 710, either via a first manifold 701 or a second manifold 702. with the ventilator 714 operating continuously, selecting the path which the gas flow takes in the apparatus, and thus selecting which filter 613 is upstream of the sensor 220, is done by suitable control of the closure devices. an important advantage of the above embodiments is that the set - up is relatively simple and robust and, in view of the fact that only a single gas sensor is needed, they do not suffer from signal biasing problems. the present invention also provides an apparatus with two ( or more ) sensors. an apparatus with two sensors involves the problem that it is difficult to ensure that the sensor responses of two different sensors positioned at two different locations areidentical. however, such an apparatus offers the advantage that it is possible to provide a continuous result in real time, thereby enabling it to quickly note rapidly changing pollution conditions, and that it is actually possible to perform two measurements on the same air sample. fig1 illustrates an embodiment of a gas sensor apparatus 800 comprising an air duct 830 with an entrance 831 for allowing an airflow of ambient air 835 to enter the duct 830 and an exit 832 for allowing the airflow to be discharged. a target gas filter 834 is arranged in the air duct 830. a first sensor 821 is arranged upstream of the filter 834, between the entrance 831 and the filter 834, and a second sensor 822 is arranged downstream of the filter 834, between the filter 834 and the exit 832. the first sensor 821 is subjected to unfiltered air upstream of the filter 834 ; therefore its measuring signal is indicated as smu. the second sensor 822 is subjected to filtered air downstream of the filter 834 ; therefore its measuring signal is indicated as smf. a calculation device 840 has a first input 841 receiving the measuring output signal smu from the first sensor 821 and a second input 842 receiving the measuring output signal smf from the second sensor 822, and is thus capable of inferring the concentration of the target gas in the air from the signals smu and smf. for driving the airflow 835, it is possible to arrange within the duct 830 an airflow generator such as for instance a ventilator, as in the case of the above - described embodiments, and such a generator may be arranged upstream or downstream of the filter 834. it is also possible to equip the apparatus with an external airflow generator, or any device capable of generating a pressure difference over the entrance 831 and output 832. it is even possible to have the apparatus cooperate with another apparatus, for instance a stand - alone air cleaner, which would include a ventilator to pass air through its cleaner units and hence causes a pressure difference. when the two sensors 821, 822 have identical characteristics, i. e. identical responses under otherwise identical conditions, their signals smu and smf can be directly compared, thus yielding a signal differential s = smu smf that is directly proportional to the target gas concentration in the unfiltered ambient air. however, it may be that the two sensors 821, 822 exhibit a ( perhaps slowly drifting ) offset signal with respect to each other, or even if they don & # 39 ; t, it may be desirable to be able to check this. fig1 illustrates an embodiment of a gas sensing apparatus 900, which is a further elaboration of the apparatus 800 of fig1. at a position downstream of the filter 834 and upstream of the second sensor 822, the duct 830 is provided with an opening 970 allowing the duct 830 to communicate with the ambient environment, which opening 970 is provided with a controllable valve or shutter or door 971, controlled by the unit 840 which now not only functions as a calculating device but also as control device. the figure illustrates the controllable shutter 971 as a moveable slide, but other implementations are also possible. when the shutter 971 is closed, the apparatus 900 is in effect equivalent to the apparatus 800 of fig1. when the shutter 971 is in its open position, both sensors 821, 822 are exposed to unfiltered ambient air. it is noted that this applies even in the absence of an external pressure difference across the duct 830, or in the absence of an otherwise forced airflow, albeit that in such a case it may take somewhat longer for the unfiltered ambient air to reach the respective sensors. preferably, the sensors 821, 822 are positioned close to the openings 831, 832, 970 to ensure quick and full exposure to unfiltered ambient air. due to the fact that sensors 821, 822 are now exposed to the same gas composition, and assuming that all other parameters at the two different sensing locations are mutually identical or do not have any significant influence on the sensor output signals, the two sensor output signals should ideally be mutually identical, and any difference between these signals represents an offset. without the cause of such offset being known, it is possible for the calculating portion of the unit 840 to compensate for the offset. thus, the apparatus 900 is capable of operating in a measuring mode and in a calibration mode, and the control device 840 is designed to regularly switch to the calibration mode. in the calibration mode, the control device 840 opens the shutter 971 and calculates the difference between the two measuring signals smu and smf received from the two sensors 821, 822, according to = smu smf. in the measuring mode, the control device 840 closes the shutter 971 and calculates a compensated measuring output signal sc of the apparatus 900 according to the formula which represents the concentration of the target gas in the unfiltered ambient air. fig1 illustrates an apparatus 1000 which is a further elaboration of the apparatus 800 of fig1, comprising a controllable bi - directional ventilator 833 arranged in the duct 830, and controlled by the control device 840 at an output 843 thereof. with the ventilator operating as shown, the operation is equivalent to that of the apparatus 800 of fig1 : the first sensor 821 is upstream of the filter 834 and provides an unfiltered measuring signal while the second sensor 822 is downstream of the filter 834 and provides a filtered measuring signal. when the control device 840 operates the ventilator 833 in the opposite direction, the second sensor 822 is upstream of the filter 834 and provides an unfiltered measuring signal while the first sensor 821 is downstream of the filter 834 and provides a filtered measuring signal. any offset between the two sensors can now be determined by comparing the two unfiltered measuring signals from the two sensors and / or by comparing the two filtered measuring signals from the two sensors. it is noted that the principles of the invention as described above do not depend on the type of gas sensor. basically, any known gas sensor can be used, or even future gas sensors will be useable. all embodiments as described are capable of automated operation without being dependent on human intervention. further, it is noted that the principles of the invention as described above do not depend on the type of target gas filter. however, it is preferred to use a filter type that combines high filter efficiency with low flow resistance and long filter lifetime. by way of example, the target gas filter structure may be a corrugated structure, a parallel - plate structure or a granular filter bed. such filters are disclosed in u. s. pat. no. 6, 071, 479 and allow for a much higher target gas filtration capacity than the sheet filters used by environmental sensors mentioned in the introduction. the corrugated structure and parallel - plate structure are preferably made from a fibrous hydrophilic paper material or from a hydrophilic glass - fiber material, which can readily be filled with an aqueous solution of the desired reagent species. after drying, the impregnated reactant species inside the filter remain hydrated in equilibrium with the ambient humidity and can subsequently absorb a target gas from the air. the granular filter is preferably composed from activated carbon, zeolites, activated alumina or any other porous granular material. these materials can also be readily impregnated. impregnation of these porous materials leaves the width of the air passage channels inside the filter essentially unchanged. thus, impregnation does not change the diffusive barrier properties of the filter structure with respect to (? ) gaseous species. the height of these filters can be readily adjusted, thereby changing the amount of impregnant that can be comprised inside these filters and thus their effective lifetime. various examples of impregnant compositions that are effective absorbers of (? ) formaldehyde, acidic gases or alkaline gases are disclosed in u. s. pat. no. 6, 071, 479. as an example, in the case that the target gas is formaldehyde, an advantageous aqueous impregnant solution comprises khco 3 ( 2 - 20 % w / w ), k 2 co 3 ( 1 - 20 % w / w ), trishydroxymethyl - aminomethane ( 3 - 30 % w / w ), kformate ( 2 - 20 % w / w ). the khco 3 and k 2 co 3 species are examples of alkaline impregnants that are capable of absorbing acidic gases such as hno x, so 2 and organic carboxylic acids from air. tris - hydroxymethyl - aminomethane is the impregnant capable of absorbing formaldehyde from air. thus, the filter comprising the more preferred impregnant solution mentioned above is capable of absorbing the class of gases comprising hno x, so 2 and organic carboxylic acids and the target gas formaldehyde. in the case that tris - hydroxymethyl - aminomethane is omitted from the preferred impregnant solution, the filter is only capable of absorbing the class of gases comprising hno x, so 2 and organic carboxylic acids. while the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, it should be clear to a person skilled in the art that such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive. the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments ; rather, several variations and modifications are possible within the protective scope of the invention as defined in the appending claims. it is noted that, in daily practice, the phrase ambient air may relate to the mixture of nitrogen and oxygen that we breathe, but in the context of the present invention, the sensing apparatus is basically applicable in any type of gas atmosphere and the phrase ambient gas is used to indicate the gas atmosphere in which the apparatus is placed. it is further noted that an apparatus according to the present invention with one gas sensor exposes the gas sensor to two different gas flows during two different time intervals, but the order of these two intervals is not essential. other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims. in the claims, the word comprising does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article a or an does not exclude a plurality. a single processor or other unit may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. the mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage. any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope. in the above, the present invention has been explained with reference to block diagrams, which illustrate functional blocks of the device according to the present invention. it is to be understood that one or more of these functional blocks may be implemented in hardware, where the function of such ( a ) functional block ( s ) is performed by individual hardware components, but it is also possible that one or more of these functional blocks are implemented in software, so that the function of such ( a ) functional block ( s ) is performed by one or more program lines of a computer program or a programmable device such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, etc.","a method of selectively sensing the concentration of a target gas in polluted ambient air comprises the steps of :  providing a target gas sensor sensitive to the target gas ;  providing a first gas flow derived from the ambient air , from which first flow the target gas is substantially removed ;  providing a second gas flow derived from the ambient air , substantially comprising the same target gas concentration as the ambient air ;  exposing the target gas sensor to the first gas flow during a first time interval , and obtaining from the sensor a first output signal ;  exposing the target gas sensor to the second gas flow during a second time interval not overlapping with the first time interval , and obtaining a second output

"according to the present invention, a process for providing a colored contact lens using a silicon rubber printing pad, or & # 34 ; tampon, & # 34 ; may be improved by the use of a specific colorant formulation. the colorant formulation of the present invention includes a non -

ionic polyalkylene oxide surfactant. these surfactants may be used alone or in combination, preferably in a 1 : 1 ratio by weight, as illustrated in the examples below. in general, the formulations useful in the present invention may include any type of coloring agent, typically an ink. however, it has been found that the present invention provides exceptionally good results when the colorant used in the formulation contains a reactive dye, such as those commonly referred to as & # 34 ; reactive dyes forming ether linkages. & # 34 ; these dyes contain reactive groups which react with cellulose to form an ether linkage, and are generally described in fiber - reactive dyes, chapter vi, by w. f. beech, saf international, inc. new york ( 1970 ), as well as in u. s. pat. nos. 4, 468, 229 ; 4, 553, 775 : 4, 553, 975 ; 4, 559, 059 and 4, 954, 132 ; all to su, and all incorporated herein by reference. the dye may also be a clear ultraviolet light blocking agent. the dye is preferably present in the colorant formulation at about 0. 5 to 15. 0 % by weight of the total mixture. generally, the colorant formulation may also comprise about 5. 0 to 30. 0 % by weight polyvinylpyrolidone and 10 to 40 % isopropyl alcohol. the remainder of the colorant formulation is preferably deionized water. the lens may be comprised of any hydrophilic material, so long as at least one of the monomeric components which form the material contains an exoskeletal functional group which can react with the dyestuff molecule. examples of such functional groups commonly present in contact lens materials are the hydroxyl, amino, amide and thio groups, and functional derivatives thereof. particularly suitable monomers for this purpose are hydroxyalkyl esters of polymerizable unsaturated acids, such as acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, fumaric and maleic acids. among such esters, hydroxyethyl methacrylate ( hema ) has been used quite extensively. the following examples will illustrate the present invention. these examples should be viewed as illustrative, without in any way limiting the scope of the instant invention. a tampo rapid 2000 / 3 pad printing machine having a yellow silicon printing pad, a turntable for manuevering a plurality of lens into a desired printing area beneath the pad, and a cliche with 9, 274 mm diameter and 0, 020mm depth, solid pattern design, all available from transtech america, inc. was used in the process. 4 ) 0. 70 g of ramazol black b dye ( from american huechst corp. ). approximately 10 ml of the colorant formulation was placed into the inkcup of the machine. the cliche was placed on the top of and tied to the inkcup using a transferable clamp. the inkcup / cliche assembly was clamped to the cliche holder of the machine, and dry hema contact lenses were placed onto the turntable. the machine was activated, and the top surface of each lens was printed with the formulation in a single step. the lenses were then left to dry for 10 minutes at room temperature ( about 23 c. ). the lenses were then placed, printed side up, into an aqueous fixing solution comprising 10 % sodium phosphate tribasic dodecahydrate and 10 % tetrabutylammonium bromide at 60 c. for 30 minutes. the lenses were then rinsed with saline and extracted for a period of ten minutes at 80 c. in a solution of 10 % glocyrol solution, then for a period of ten minutes at 80 c. in a fresh solution of 10 % glocyrol solution, then for a period of ten minutes at 80 c. in deionized water, and finally for a period of one hour at 80 c. in phosphate buffered saline. the finished lens had an unblemished coating of blueish -

ionic polyalkylene oxide surfactant to the colorant formulation. it also illustrates that a mixture of surfynol 104 pa and surfynol 420 is particularly useful in accordance with the present invention.","a contact lens colorant formulation containing a surfactant is applied to a dry hydrophilic contact lens by means of a silicon rubber printing pad to provide a cosmetically acceptable , solid , unblemished covering . this process allows for a solid covering to be placed onto the lens in a single printing step using standard transfer printing devices ."
"as noted above, images and metrics of the left ventricle and left ventricular function provide valuable information concerning cardiac health. however, existing methods for identifying and analyzing cardiac structures have difficulty accurately handling irregular structures such as the outer edge of the left ventricle at the basal or apical ends. moreover, such methods often entail increased cost due to the requirement for extensive human intervention to achieve acceptable accuracy. manual tracing has been considered the gold - standard for cardiac output quantification in clinical practice. however, manual tracing is labor - intensive and time consuming, and the results are subject to inter - and intra - observer variability. additionally, complex cardiac structures such as papillary and trabecular muscles make it difficult to accurately trace the left ventricle margins in detail. attempts to automate such processes have proven less than fully satisfactory. in the following description, various embodiments of the present invention will be described. for purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. however, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. furthermore, well - known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described. referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numerals represent like parts throughout the several views, fig1 shows an imaging system 20 in accordance with an embodiment. the imaging system 20 includes a scanner 22 in communication with a control cpu 24 for controlling the scanner 22, an operator station 26 for allowing human control of the control cpu 24 and scanner 22, and an image processor 28 for analyzing images of subjects scanned by the scanner 22. the scanner 22 can be any device capable of measuring data from an object, such as a person, for later processing into images. in an embodiment the scanner 22 is a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scanner and includes a radio frequency ( rf ) coil 30, an x - gradient 32, a y - gradient 34, and a z - gradient 36, all controlled by the control cpu 24. the scanner 22 operates by creating a uniform magnetic field around an object to be scanned and emitting through the rf coil 30 radio waves into the subject. the x gradient 32, y gradient 34, and z gradient 36 are operated by the control cpu 24 so as to control the location in the subject being scanned. generally, scanners such as the scanner 22 include a chamber 38 from which a table 40 extends. typically, a patient 42 or other subject lies on the table 40 which is mechanically operated so as to place the patient 42 into the chamber 38 for scanning. looking to fig2, when the patient 42 is being scanned by the scanner 22, the scanner 22 scans the patient 42 about a scanning plane 44 so as to collect data for an image of the patient 42 at an intersection of the scanning plane 44 and the patient 42. for example, as shown in fig2 the plane 44 is normal to the patient & # 39 ; s 42 length, intersecting the patient 42 through his or her chest in order to produce a picture of a cross section of the patient 42. generally, the scanning plane 44 can intersect the patient 42 at any orientation, as determined by the x - gradient 32, y - gradient 34, and z - gradient 36. the resulting picture of the scanning shown in fig2 is seen on a slice 46 which shows a left ventricle 48, myocardium 50, right ventricle 52, and other structures located in the patient 42. in an embodiment, the slice 46 is one of many pictures taken at the same location at different times. as noted above, such slices can be referred to as frames. fig3 shows a schematic representation of the imaging system 20, in accordance with an embodiment. the imaging system 20 includes imaging hardware 54, such as the scanner 22, control cpu 24, operating station 26, and image processor 28, described above in connection with fig1. located on the imaging hardware 54, such as on the operator station 26, is an operating system 56, such as a unix operating system. installed in the operating system 56 is imaging and data gathering software 58 used to control the scanner 22 and convert measurements of the scanner 22 into image data. an example of image / data gathering software is the ge advantage workstation available from general electric. in addition to the data gathering software, additional add - on modules can also be included, such as a segmentation module 60, which, in an embodiment, is a computer program or other mechanism for analyzing image data. it will be appreciated that each program, module, and functional computational unit described herein, and each step executed by the automatic system, is implemented in an embodiment by a computer or computing device ( generically computer ) reading computer - executable instructions from a computer - readable medium and executing said instructions or causing them to be executed. the computer - readable medium is a physical fixed medium such as a magnetic or optically readable ( and potentially writable ) disc, circuit, array, or other physically tangible element. in an alternative embodiment, transient computer - readable media may be used additionally or alternatively. such media include radio and optical transmissions ( generically electromagnetic transmissions ), audio transmissions, whether human - perceivable or not, and so on. it will be appreciated that computer - readable media are distinct from transient computer - readable media. fig4 shows an image 62, in accordance with an embodiment. as shown in the drawing, the image 62 is a series of slices 64 which are parallel two - dimensional pictures of a scanned object taken a short distance, such as one millimeter apart, from one another. in the image 62 shown in fig4, the slices 64 begin at an initial mid - ventricular slice 66 and end at an apical slice 68. fig5 shows the image 62 and a voxel 70 of the image 62. as shown in the drawing, the voxel 70 represents a rectangular - prism shaped location of the left ventricle 48 corresponding to a mid - ventricular slice 71. in an embodiment, the voxel 70 includes information about the intensity of the corresponding location of the left ventricle 48, as measured by the scanner 22. the image 62 comprises a collection of similarly shaped voxels, each voxel carrying information about the intensity of its corresponding location. the voxels of the image 62 can also include information additional or alternative to intensity, and the information carried by each voxel can depend on the type of device used to obtain the image 62. as noted above, left ventricular stroke volume and ejection fraction are important clinical indicators for diagnosing cardiovascular disease and for monitoring the effects of cardiotoxic drug therapies. accurate lv segmentation is vital for proper quantification ; the inclusion or exclusion of papillary and trabecular structures in the blood volume affects ejection fraction by clinically significant amounts. in an embodiment of the invention, a novel technique for soft - segmentation is introduced. the blood volume of the left ventricle, accounting for papillary, trabecular, and partial voxels, is measured automatically for all phases and a user - selected range of slices. no prior shape information is assumed, except that the blood pool is enclosed by myocardium. full - blood and full - myocardium signal statistics are estimated, and the blood content of the left ventricle is then quantified on a voxel - by - voxel basis. all slices, including basal and apical, are segmented ; however, additional minimal user interaction may be necessary at basal slices. cardiac cine ssfp scans were performed on numerous patients with a ge signa 1. 5t scanner, with imaging parameters tr 3. 4 - 4. 5 ms, te 1. 1 - 1. 9 ms, flip angle 55 - 60, matrix size 192 192 - 256 256, image dimensions 256 256, receiver bandwidth 125 khz, fov 320 288 - 360 360, slice thickness 6 - 8 mm, and slice gap 2 - 4 mm. the left ventricle in each patient was imaged in 6 - 10 slices, 20 - 28 cardiac phases. in this embodiment of the invention, as represented in fig6, segmentation is performed in 6 steps as follows : 1 ) ( seeding step 74 ) estimate lv center point at a user - selected mid - ventricular slice via the hough transform, 2 ) ( initial volume location step 76 ) measure b and b through edge - detection region - growth, 3 ) ( sensitivity correction step 78 ) least - square fit a planar surface to the full - blood voxels to compensate for coil sensitivity variations, 4 ) ( iterative thresholding step 80 ) estimate m, 5 ) ( volume growth step 82 and partial volume calculation step 84 ) interpolate blood content of the voxels composing the lv cavity, and 6 ) ( seed propagation step 86 ) propagate the segmentation seed point to an appropriate position in the next slice / phase. steps 2 - 6 are repeated upon propagation, until all phases and all slices, the range of which is selected by the user, have been completed. in alternate embodiments, the above steps can be ordered differently and, in general, one step need follow another only when necessary. at the seeding step 74, the hough transform is performed on an initial mid - ventricular slice, selected by the user, to identify a point specifying a full - blood voxel within the left ventricular cavity. one or more voxels for a seed can alternatively be chosen manually, or through other methods capable of locating voxels in the left ventricle or other object intended to be seeded. for remaining slices and phases, a seed propagation technique is used after segmentation ( seed propagation step 86 ). at the initial volume location step 76, edge - based region - growth ( 8 - connected 2d, 10 - connected 3d ) is performed from the given seed point to discover voxels that are approximately full - blood. region growth from the voxel 70 is demonstrated in fig7, where the arrows normal to faces of the voxel 70 show the directions in which growth occurs. in addition to the directions shown in the drawing, region growth can proceed diagonally, in a plane and / or to other slices. the identified full - blood region 88 can be seen in fig8, which shows an original image slide 90 adjacent to a partially segmented slide 92 showing the full - blood region 88. as shown in the drawing, the full - blood region does not occupy the entire left ventricle 48 as voxels at an outer edge of the left ventricle 48 have been identified as not containing full blood and therefore have not been included in the full - blood region 88. the mean and standard deviation ( b and b ) of this sample area is calculated, and the volume contribution from these voxels in all subsequent calculations is considered as full - blood. at the coil sensitivity correction step 78, a least - squares planar surface is fit to the intensities of the voxels sampled by the second step in order to approximate and compensate for coil sensitivity variations across the area of the left ventricle. the plane is restricted by an upper and lower bound, according to maximum and minimum intensities observed over the sampled full - blood voxels. in general, any corrective technique can be employed according to the particular device used to obtain the image 62 and correction can be omitted when appropriate, such as when the device is of a type not requiring correction. in order to estimate the myocardium mean signal intensity, at the iterative thresholding step 80, successive threshold based region - growth processes are run for an iteratively decreasing threshold, using the same seed as the second step. eventually, region - growth leaks through the myocardium, spilling into surrounding structures ( e. g., fatty tissue, right - ventricle, muscle, etc. ) causing a discontinuity in the second - derivative of volume growth. this discontinuity can be used to detect at what threshold ( an effusion threshold ) region - growth has broken the bound of the myocardium. an embodiment for a process for the iterative thresholding step 80 can be seen in more detail in fig6 a. in an embodiment the seed from the seed selection step 74 is identified at a seed selection step 80 a. an index and a threshold value, each is updated each iteration, are initialized at an initialization step 80 b. at a region growth step 80 c, a region is grown from the seed identified in the seed selection step 80 a. the volume of the grown region is calculated at volume calculation step 80 d by summing the individual volumes of the voxels identified as part of the region. in order to ensure that at least two volumes are calculated, an index checking step 80 e looks at the value of the index and proceeds to an update step 80 f, in which the index and threshold are updated for the next iteration. if it is determined at the index checking step 80 e that the index is large enough, the rate of the volume growth between consecutive iterations is calculated at a volume rate step 80 g. if there is has not been a sudden increase in the volume of the region grown, the update step 80 f is performed again. if there has been a sudden increase in the volume of the region grown, at a myocardium mean step 80 h, the myocardial mean value is calculated according to the threshold at which the sudden volume growth occurred. the results of the iterative thresholding step 80 can be seen in fig9, which shows a left image 94 of an original image on the left, a middle slice 96 of the original image where region growth has occurred below the effusion threshold, and a right slice 98 where region growth has occurred at the effusion threshold. in the middle slice 96, the region growth has only detected parts of the left ventricle 48, as indicated by the shaded left ventricle 48. at the effusion threshold, the region growth has captured part of the right ventricle 52, causing the volume of the region to suddenly increase at a high rate. fig9 ( a ) shows the transition across the effusion threshold in more detail. the left image shows the region grown in the left ventricle several iterations before the effusion threshold is reached. as the effusion threshold is approached, more of the left region becomes part of the left ventricle, including voxels around the edge of the region shown in the left image, which are shown with a lighter dotted pattern. once the effusion threshold is reached, the right ventricle 52 is captured. the sudden increase in volume can be seen in fig1, showing a plot of the volume of the region growth as the threshold is decreased, as indicated as an increasing r - value on the horizontal axis. notably, the volume of the region ( in terms of the number of voxels contained in the region ) increases slightly but remains between 0 and 2000 voxels until the threshold is decreased enough that the volume of the region jumps to just over 8000 voxels. also notable is that, as the threshold is decreased even more, the volume slightly increases again until making another sudden jump to approximately 13000 voxels, when the region leaks into even more structures in the image 62, such as fat, muscle, liver, and other parts surrounding the heart. therefore, iterative thresholding is an effective method for iteratively identifying any number of objects in an image having some characteristic or attribute that varies among the objects. fig1 shows the effect of iterative thresholding in terms of the second derivative of the volume, which is actually a discrete analogue of a second derivative as the region growth is a discrete process. looking at the graph, whose horizontal axis increases as the threshold decreases, the point at which the volume suddenly increases is shown by a large hill 102 in the figure, which is caused by the sudden acceleration of the volume at the effusion threshold. likewise, a smaller hill 104 to the right of the steep hill 102 corresponds to the second sudden jump in volume. the threshold at which region - growth spills into surrounding structures is strongly correlated with the mean, standard deviation, and thickness of the myocardium, as seen in simulations such as that shown in fig1 and 12 ( a ), which shows a simulation of threshold - based region growth seeded at the center of a ring of normally distributed intensities. wall thickness is represented along the horizontal axis and the vertical axis represents the threshold ( effusion threshold or leak threshold ) at which region growth breaks the bounds of the ring, in terms of standard deviations above the mean. as the values on the horizontal axis approach infinity, the effusion threshold converges to 0. 2 in the simulation. a fixed constant can be used to predict the distance, in terms of standard deviations, of the mean from the leak threshold, over a range of expected myocardium thicknesses, with little influence in aggregate volume estimation from estimate error ( see appendix ). for this example, a fixed distance of 0. 9 standard deviations was chosen, with b being used as an estimate of m. in a sample of 23 slices from patient cases, the two were found to be well correlated, as shown in fig1, a graph showing a correlation between b and m across 23 sample images from a database of 40 patients in which full - blood and full - myocardium voxels were manually traced and care was taken to exclude partial voxels ( voxels corresponding to a region that is not completely or not nearly fully filled with blood ) from the measurement. the total blood volume of the left ventricle is determined by the summation : v = x h ( x ) w ( x ), [ eq. 1 ] where v is volume, h ( x ) is the histogram of the left ventricle, and w ( x ) is the weight ( voxel percent blood content ) associated with voxels of intensity x. assuming a noiseless system and a good point spread function, w ( x ) = x - m b - m, [ eq. 2 ] where b and m are the signal intensities associated with full - blood and full - myocardium, respectively. accounting for gaussian noise, b and m are assigned ( b n b ) and ( m + n b ) respectively, where n = 2. the assignments ensure at least 99. 4 % of full - blood and full - myocardium voxels will be weighted correctly, while maintaining the proportionality of partial voxel interpolation. region - growth is then performed again for the last time, using a threshold of ( m + n ). except for voxels visited during the second step, which are always counted as full - blood, the blood content of each voxel visited is interpolated using eq. 2. the seed point for the next slice or phase is determined by examining an 11 11 window in the next image centered about the previous slice segmentation & # 39 ; s center - of - mass. an energy function based on distance from the center of the window and the intensity difference from the previous slice & # 39 ; s blood mean is applied to each pixel in the window : e ( p ) = 2 prev w - 1 p com - p ) 2 + ( i new ( p ) - prev ) 2 [ eq. 3 ] where p is the evaluated pixel position, inew ( p ) is the intensity of the evaluated pixel, pcom is the center - of - mass of the previous segmentation, w = 11 is the window width, and / prev is / b of the previous segmentation. the pixel with the lowest energy is chosen as the next seed point. steps 2 - 6 are then repeated on the new image using the selected seed point. in this embodiment of the invention, while the shape of the endocardium as a contour cannot be perfectly reconstructed due to blurring of complicated structures, the blood content ( volume ) of the left ventricle can be closely reconstructed with linear or other combination of signals and a good point - spread function. this system has demonstrated a robust ability to quantify volume with good accuracy in substantially less time than manual segmentation, and is able to capture structural complexities of the left ventricle in vivo not attainable by human contour tracers in a practical amount of time. while some user interaction was necessary at the basal slices to close the myocardium, these slices can be skipped until automated segmentation has completed all other phases and slices. end - diastole and end - systole can then be correctly identified, and the remaining basal slices segmented with minimal user assistance. such a process would limit the number of slices requiring manual input to 2 or less per case ( corresponding to each end phase ). volume error resulting from incorrectly estimating the myocardial signal mean is roughly equal to the signal estimation error, the difference between the two means, and the proportion of partial voxels. assuming the partial volume histogram is relatively constant : err e ( m ) - m u b - m pvp where err is the relative error, e ( m ) is the estimated m and pvp is the proportion of the total volume contributed by partial voxels. significant errors in e ( m ) lead to insignificant errors in total volume, since the scale factor ( b m ) is on average 2. 5 times larger than m alone ( evaluated from a sample 23 slices of group a ). as an example, a 50 % error of myocardium mean estimation with 25 % total volume contributed by partial voxels would roughly translate to a 5 % error in the total volume. table 1 shown in fig1 shows average segmentation results. manual volume measurements were significantly larger than their pvs counterparts. percent volume contribution from partial voxels is as reported by the pvs algorithm. relative difference is the subtraction of pvs from manual, scaled by manual ; positive values imply manual value was greater than pvs. table 2 shown in fig1 shows average segmentation results from a different experimental group. manual method 1 includes papillary / trabeculae in the blood volume. method 2 excludes. percent volume contribution from partial voxels is as reported by the pvs algorithm. relative difference is the subtraction of pvs from manual, scaled by manual ; positive values imply manual value was greater than pvs. the results of pvs can be seen in fig1 ( a ). the top row, excluding the last column, shows the results of manual segmentation, in which a thin contour extends around the left ventricle. the second row, excluding the last column, shows a determination of the left ventricle through pvs. the middle of each image is uniform in intensity, corresponding to full - blood voxels of the left ventricle. at the edge of each uniform region, the voxels vary in intensity according to the amount of blood in each voxel. this effect is seen in greater detail in the third row, excluding the last column, where the full - blood voxels are darkened in order to highlight the partial voxels surrounding the left ventricle. in an embodiment of the invention, left ventricle segmentation employs an automated left ventricle segmentation algorithm using graph searching based on intensity and gradient information and a priori knowledge for short axis cardiac mri. this technique is referred to herein by the shorthand moniker lvgiga. the lvgiga technique as described herein was implemented with coil sensitivity non - uniformity correction and polar coordinate transformation. graph searching and expansion were applied for extracting myocardial endocardial and epicardial borders. left ventricle blood and myocardium intensities were estimated for accurate partial volume calculation of blood volume and myocardial mass. for the base data, cardiac cine ssfp images were acquired from numerous patients. the lvgiga algorithm was used to measure blood volume, myocardial mass and ejection fraction, and compared with clinical manual tracing and commercially available mass software. it was found that the success rate for segmenting both endocardial and epicardial borders was 95. 6 % for lvgiga and 37. 8 % for mass ( excluding basal slices that required manual enclosure of ventricle blood ). the lvgiga segmentation result agreed well with manual tracing ( full volume calculation ) with an accuracy of 2. 9 4. 4 ml, 2. 1 2. 2 %, and 9. 6 13. 0 g for blood volume, ejection fraction, and myocardial mass, respectively. as such, it is apparent that the lvgiga algorithm substantially improves the robustness of lv segmentation automation over the commercial mass software. the following common information from short - axis cardiac mri is used in lvgiga : lv blood is surrounded by myocardium, lv is circular, blood has similar signal intensity, myocardium has similar signal intensity, and blood signal intensity is sharply different from myocardium. using this base knowledge, the lvgiga method calculates the partial volume of lv as shown in fig1 and 17. in overview, the method entails executing the following steps : ( 1 ) extracting initial lv using region growth ( lv estimation step 110 ) ; ( 2 ) correcting coil sensitivity of image and remove noisy variation ( sensitivity correction step 112 ) ; ( 3 ) segmenting lv and myocardium ; ( 3. 1 ) generating circular map from corrected image ( circular mapping step 114 ) ; ( 3. 2 ) estimating intensity statistics of lv and myocardium using edge classification ( edge detection step 116 ) ; ( 3. 3 ) extracting myocardium by graph searching and expansion ( center axis extraction step 118 and axis expansion step 120 ) ; ( 3. 4 ) detecting lv by region - growing segmentation ( continued growth step 122 ) ; ( 3. 5 ) transforming coordinate from circular map to image ( remapping step 124 ) ; and ( 4 ) calculating partial volume of lv ( partial volume calculation step 126 ). on short axis cine mri magnitude images, one can extract an initial lv by region - growing from a user - selected point with a tight constraint of less than 5 % intensity difference among neighboring points. extraction in such a manner is advantageous as it is a computationally simple mechanism for obtaining basis statistics about the lv region, such as the mean intensity. however, other mechanisms for selecting the initial lv region can be used, such as manually selecting the lv region. in an embodiment of the invention, image intensity variation due to non - uniform surface coil array sensitivity is corrected by first fitting a plane equation f ( x, y ) by a least - square solution using pixels in the initial lv, and then dividing the image intensity by a factor where i and j are [ 1, m ] and [ 1, n ], and m and n represent the width and height of images, and cx and cy represent the x and y coordinate of center - of - gravity in the initial lv. fig1 shows coil sensitivity correction results, which include magnitude images 130, residual images 132, pre - correction intensity profiles 134, and post - correction intensity profiles 136. residual images represent the intensity difference between before and after coil sensitivity correction, a necessary step for automated segmentation. for increasing the robustness in edge detections of later steps, denoising pre - filtering is applied to obtain a pre - filtered and corrected image. the method then calculates blood intensity mean and standard deviation, b mean0 and b std0, of the initial lv from the coil sensitivity corrected image and blood intensity mean and standard deviation, b mean1 and b std1, from the pre - filtered and coil corrected image. since the lv has a generally circular shape, the method can generate a circular map by polar mapping, where the center of polar - mapping is the center - of - gravity ( such as a center of intensity or center of other characteristic or attribute ) from the initial lv, by converting cartesian coordinate ( x, y ) to polar coordinate ( radius r, radian ). in an embodiment of the invention, the radius of the circular region is roughly selected to cover the cardiac area. other coordinate systems can also be used. for example, the method can leave the image in rectangular coordinates or it can map to any other convenient coordinate system. rough statistical estimation of lv blood and myocardium using edge classification in an embodiment of the invention, as shown in fig1, the method extracts edge information by the canny detector from the circular map of the denoised coil - corrected image, and classifies two edges in the following manner. points for the 1st edge are identified by searching in the radius r direction from the lv gravity center using the constraint that intensity at the left of the edge is larger than intensity at the right of the edge by b std1 or more. points for the 2nd edge are identified by searching further in the radius r direction from the 1st edge using the constraint that intensity at the left of the edge is less than b mean1 b std1. fig1 ( a ) shows the canny edge detection and fig1 ( b ) shows the 1st edge 142 and 2nd edge 144 classification. intensity differences are shown in fig1 ( c ). next, as shown in fig1 ( i ), in radius direction, the system calculates an intensity histogram between the lv center and points identified on the 1st edge as the histogram of lv blood. similarly, it calculates in the radius direction a histogram between the 1st edge and 2nd edge as the histogram of myocardium. finally, as seen by the shaded areas in fig1 ( i ), the method estimates the mean of lv blood intensity, b mean2, and the mean of myocardium intensity, m mean2, from the maximum frequent location in the smoothed blood and myocardium histogram. in an embodiment of the invention, the method detects the center axis of the myocardium by a graph searching technique and extracts the myocardium by expanding the myocardium center axis using its intensity statistics. a graph is constructed assuming that each pixel is connected with its neighboring pixels in the radian direction on the circular map. a cost in each node of the graph is computed by combining the normalized intensity difference and gradient, shown in fig1 ( d ), as follows : cost = w i i ( i, j ) - m mean 2 max ( i ( i, j ) ) + w 2 ( g ( i, j ) max ( g ( i, j ) ) ) where i is the image output from step 2, g is its corresponding gradient f, and m mean2 is as derived above. cost is low when intensity is similar to m mean2 and gradient is small ( e. g., for locations far from edges ). the values w 1 and w 2 are weighting constants to control dependency and both can be set to 1. 0 or any other value as necessary. this procedure is illustrated in fig1 ( c ) - ( e ). fig1 ( e ) shows the cost function in each pixel of the graph with brightness representing cost and fig1 ( f ) shows the accumulated cost. the graph searching technique is applied to find the minimal cost path in the radian direction. in particular the method calculates accumulated cost in each pixel by adding the minimum cost in previous pixels, - 1, and a weighted distance to its own cost as follows : acccost = cost ( i, j ) + min { cost ( i + k, j 1 ) } + w 3 dist ( k ) where k is a searching range of previous pixels, w 3 is a weighting constant and we set as 0. 01 and dist ( k ) represents a distance from the previous minimum cost pixel. after calculating the accumulated cost from the beginning ( j = 1 ) to the end ( j = n ), the system reversely traverses pixels with minimum accumulated cost in searching range k. during traversing, edge information is used to avoid searching beyond the edge. the retrieved minimum cost path is defined as the myocardium center axis. the process then calculates the mean and standard deviation, m mean3 and m std3, of the myocardium center axis and expands that center axis to detect the myocardium. this expansion is performed in radius r and radian direction by comparing intensity. while i ( i, j ) i ( a x, a y ) & lt ; w 4 mc std3 is satisfied, the process continues the expansion. otherwise, the method ceases expansion in that direction. the parameters a x and a y represent the pixel in the myocardium center axis. the value w 4 is a weighting constant. in an embodiment of the invention, w 4 is set to 1. 2 and 2. 0 for endocardial and epicardial contour detection, respectively. fig1 ( g ) - ( h ) show the myocardium center axis 158 and myocardium 50 by graph searching and expansion. as shown in fig2, the epicardial contour in an mri may not be well defined when the intensity differences between myocardium and other tissues are small. fig2 ( a ) illustrates a case where arrows point to locations with problematic epicardial contour definition in a circular map. as a result, myocardium region expansion in the radius direction ( searching for epicardial contour ) has a leakage problem as shown in fig2 ( b ) - ( c ), in particular, as shown by the arrows in the fig2 ( b ). in an embodiment of the invention, this leakage may be apodized in the following manner. first, the method calculates the average distance between the endocardial contour and myocardium center axis 158 ( half thickness, th ), and the average distance between the endocardial contour and epicardial contour ( full thickness, tf ). as shown in fig2 ( b ), precise epicardial contour points are retrieved by searching points with myocardial thickness in the range ( tf th, tf + th ). then, the algorithm traces the epicardial contour along the - direction forward and backward, where if a consecutive change in myocardial thickness is larger than th, the epicardial radial location at that point is set to the radial location of its preceding contour point ( see fig2 ( c ) - ( d ) which show forward contour tracing and backward contour tracing, respectively ). finally, the epicardial contour & # 39 ; s radial position is updated with the minimum among the forward and backward contour tracings ( see fig2 ( e ) ). to remove small variations or noise, the method applies low - pass filtering to the epicardial contour ( see fig2 ( f ) - ( g ) ). next the lv is segmented by a region - growing method. on the circular map, region - growing starts from the initial l. the region grows if the signal intensity of each pixel is larger than region - growing threshold m mean3 + w 5 m std3 with w 5 = 1. 2. the region - growing stops if it meets the myocardium extracted above. in other words, the myocardium is a constraint to block region - growing in the radial direction. the segmented lv blood and myocardium is converted from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinate, using inverse calculation of the polar mapping. recall that the system has segmented lv and calculated intensity statistics of the lv and myocardium : b mean0, b std0, m mean3, and m std3. in order to design an intensity weighting function for calculating partial volume of lv, two constants, m right and b left, are defined as follows : where w 6 and w 7 are constants to control volume calculation and are set to 1. 2 and 1. 2, respectively. using these values, the intensity weight function is designed as follows : here i c only contains the coil sensitivity correction, avoiding denoising pre - filtering that may obscure the fine details of papillary and trabeculae muscles ( ptm ). the designed intensity weighting function for partial volume calculation is shown in the slide 174 of fig1, where the histogram of lv blood is represented by the right - most histogram, the histogram of myocardium is in on the left, and the ptms are indicated by arrows. to evaluate the described system, cardiac cine ssfp were acquired from a number of patients using a ge signa 1. 5t scanner. the imaging parameters were tr 3. 3 - 4. 5 ms, te 1. 1 - 2. 0 ms, flip angle 55 - 60, matrix size 192 192 - 256 256, image dimensions 256 256, receiver bandwidth 125 khz, fov 290 - 400 240 - 360, slice thickness 6 - 8 mm, and slice gap 2 - 4 mm. the lv in each subject was imaged in 6 - 10 slices, 20 - 28 cardiac phases. a total of 635 images ( two cardiac phases, systole and diastole, from all patients ) were segmented by manual tracing, the described lvgiga segmentation, and the mass commercial software. manual tracing was performed with papillary and trabeculae muscles excluded from the blood volume. trabeculae were defined as myocardium protruding & gt ; 1. 5 mm from the circumferential contour of the lv cavity, with equivalent signal intensity to the adjacent lv wall. basal image positions were defined by the most basal image encompassing at least 50 % of circumferential myocardium, and did not vary in automated analyses. all tracings were performed blinded to other automated results. endocardial volume in diastolic and systolic phase, epicardial volume, and ejection fraction were measured using our lvgiga segmentation and compared with manual tracing and the commercial mass software ( mass analysis, general electric, waukesha, wis. ). we calculated both full volume ( fv, without partial volume consideration ) and partial volume ( pv ) for lv endocardial volume at both diastole and systole. we measured the diastolic epicardial volume ( including both lv blood and myocardium ). myocardium mass was derived from the epicardial volume and endocardial volume difference multiplied by the density of myocardium ( 1. 05 g / ml ). linear regression and bland - altman analysis were performed to assess the correlation between manual tracing with the mass software and our lvgiga segmentation. the performances of automated algorithms lvgiga and mass were evaluated in the following manner. when either of these two automated algorithms generated a contour that deviated from the lv border by more than 10 % in area as visually estimated by the operator, the algorithm was judged to have failed and the contour mis - segmentation was then corrected by user intervention. the number of user interventions was recorded for each algorithm. the endocardial blood volume in diastolic and systolic phase, the ejection fraction, the epicardial volume in diastole, and the myocardial mass were 144. 5 50. 0 ml, 60. 5 44. 7 ml, 61. 5 14. 3 %, 266. 5 91. 5 ml, 128. 1 50. 9 g for measurement with manual tracing, 146. 8 50. 5 ml, 64. 1 45. 0 ml, 59. 4 14. 1 %, 277. 9 90. 7 ml, 137. 7 49. 1 g for measurement with the lvgiga algorithm, and 164. 5 55. 1 ml, 73. 2 51. 5 ml, 58. 8 14. 3 %, 287. 4 101. 1 ml, 129. 1 57. 5 g for measurement with the mass software. comparisons of manual tracing with the lvgiga segmentation and of manual tracing with the mass software are summarized in table 1 ( fig2 ) and fig2. while blood volume measurements from the lvgiga algorithm in full volume were similar to that of manual tracing, corresponding lvgiga blood volume measurements in partial volume were smaller than manual tracing, and mass blood volume measurements were larger than manual tracing because papillary and trabeculae muscles were not excluded. however, the ejection fraction measurements were similar for all three measurement methods, manual tracing, lvgiga, and mass. both lvgiga and mass showed slightly poorer correlation with manual tracing for myocardial mass measurements than for blood volume measurements, possibly due to additional discordance in epicardial contour segmentation. these agreements and disagreements among manual tracing, lvgiga, and mass are illustrated in the bland - altman plots in fig2. table 2 ( fig2 ) summarizes the number of user interventions to correct for mis - segmentations for both lvgiga and mass software. while basal slices are problematic for both lvgiga and mass because of the lv outflow tract disruption of the myocardial border, the lvgiga drastically reduced the number of intervention needed by mass for both endocardial ( from 10. 6 % to 0. 6 % slices ) and epicardial ( from 51. 6 % to 3. 8 % slices ) contour segmentation. excluding the basal slices, lvgiga has a success rate of 95. 6 % and mass 37. 8 % for lv segmentation. fig2 shows an example of lv segmentation using the three methods, illustrating the quality in defining endocardial 176 and epicardial 178 contours, and partial volume. the top row of pictures are original intensity images. the next three rows relate to the lvgiga method, in particular, by row order, to segmenting left ventricles, myocardiums, and finding partial volumes, respectively. moving further down the figure, the next row shows segmentation by manual tracing. the penultimate row shows mass segmented left ventricles and myocardiums before manual intervention and the last row shows mass segmented left ventricles and myocardiums after manual intervention. the data demonstrate that the described left ventricle segmentation algorithm based on graph searching using both intensity and gradient information and simple a priori knowledge ( lvgiga ) provides lv segmentation in good agreement with clinical manual tracing and improves substantially the robustness of accurate automation over commercial mass software. additionally, the lvgiga algorithm is capable of separating blood and myocardium within the same voxel, potentiating accurate measurements of small structures and partial volumes. the myocardial enclosure geometry allows identification of the inner endocardial border as the first significant gradient line and the outer epicardial border as the second significant gradient line in the polar coordinate. blood and myocardial intensity statistics are iteratively estimated as endocardial and epicardial border definitions improve during the segmentation. intensity and gradient information are combined to determine the cost function for graph searching and expansion, which is further constrained by smoothness of myocardial thickness. in this manner, the lvgiga algorithm accurately identifies endocardial and epicardial borders and blood and myocardial signal statistics for blood volume and myocardial mass measurements. when the myocardial contour is disrupted by the lv outflow tract in the basalmost slice, lvgiga requires manual intervention though less frequently than the commercial mass software. otherwise, lvgiga almost eliminates the need for manual intervention, while mass software requires manual intervention in about half of the slices. with regard to automation robustness, lvgiga offers a substantial improvement over mass. in the 4 non - basal slices where lvgiga failed to identify the endocardial border, two were apical slices where lvgiga was unable to define the lv gravity center due to irregular blood and myocardium distribution, while the other two slices had very bright areas within the myocardium. in the cases lvgiga failed to accurately identify the epicardial border, there was an insufficient difference in signal intensity between myocardium and adjacent organs such as the lungs, causing the segmented myocardium to include these tissues. also, the smoothing during the epicardial contour detection process tends to ignore possible complex myocardial texture, resulting under - segmentation. in comparison, the endocardial border has clear boundary between lv and myocardium and require no smoothing in detection. this may explain that the epicardial volume difference with manual tracing was found to be larger than endocardial volume difference. this under - segmentation problem may be addressed by integrating the lvgiga output into active contour model or level - set methods. the denoising pre - filtering is beneficial for reliable estimation of edges in lvgiga algorithm, but it also smoothes out fine muscular structures, resulting in apparent over - segmentation for blood. the partial volume calculation of blood volume and myocardial volume compensate for this problem using pre - denoised images. conceptually, the partial volume calculation is significant for the accurate volume determination from cine cardiac mr images, which are typically acquired using 10 mm thick slices ( including gap ) and consequently have substantial voxels that contain a mixture of blood and myocardium. to evaluate these partial volume effects, a true reference standard for blood volume and myocardial mass is beneficial. in an alternative embodiment, after coil - sensitivity is compensated for, and the lv endocardium is segmented by a seeded region growing scheme whose threshold is iteratively determined by detecting the effusion into the surrounding myocardium and tissues. then, to extract the epicardium, a circular map is generated, edge information of the lv is calculated, and the active contour model guided by the endocardial border and the myocardial signal information estimated by iterative thresholding is used to extract the epicardial contour. this iterative thresholding and active contour model with adaptation ( ithaca ) algorithm was compared to manual tracing and the commercial mass analysis software ( general electric ). the ithaca algorithm was found to be a substantial improvement over the mass software in defining myocardial borders and agreed well with manual tracing with a mean difference of blood volume and myocardial mass were 2. 9 6. 2 ml ( mean standard deviation ) and 0. 9 16. 5 g, respectively. the difference was smaller than the difference between manual tracing and the mass software ( 20. 0 6. 9 ml and 1. 0 20. 2 g, respectively ). in overview, in order to segment the endocardium, the coil - sensitivity of the magnitude image is corrected and a seed region - growing scheme is applied where the threshold is determined iteratively by detecting the effusion into surrounding structures. to detect the epicardial contour and segment the myocardium ( myoc ), a circular map ( cmap ) is generated by polar mapping, and edge information is extracted on the cmap and filtered using the endocardial segmentation. after defining an external force and constraints with information obtained from endocardium segmentation, the active contour model is applied to find the epicardial contour. in this embodiment of the invention, the automatic lv segmentation algorithm consists of a soft endocardial contour extraction by iterative thresholding, and an epicardial contour extraction by active contour modeling. the soft endocardial contour segmentation algorithm entails the following 5 steps : each of these steps will be discussed in greater detail below. to identify a seed point within the lv cavity, a circular hough transform is performed on the subtraction magnitude of images from phases 1 and 10 ( roughly corresponding to diastole and systole, respectively ) of an initial mid - ventricular slice, selected by the user. a seed propagation technique is applied for the remaining slices and phases, where the seed point for the current slice or phase image is determined by examining an 11 11 pixel window whose center is the center of gravity of the segmented lv region in the previous image. the energy of each pixel in the window is calculated based on the distance from the center of the window and the intensity difference from the mean of lv region in the previous image : e ( p ) = ( ( 2 prev w - 1 p cog - p ) 2 + i new ( p ) - prev ) 2 where p is the evaluated pixel position, i new ( p ) is the intensity of the evaluated pixel, p cog is the center - of - gravity of lv region in the previous image, w = 11 is the window width in number of voxels, and prev and prev is the mean and standard deviation of lv region in the previous image. the pixel with the lowest energy is chosen as the seed point. an edge - based region - growing scheme is performed from the initial seed point to find an lv region that is nearly full - blood. the mean and standard deviation ( lv mean and lv std ) of this lv region is calculated, and the voxels visited in this step are considered as full - blood in all subsequent calculations. images from the mr scanner can have distortions depending on coil location that can affect segmentation and partial volume calculations. to compensate coil sensitivity across the area of the lv, a planar surface is fit to the voxels visited using least - squares. in order to estimate the mean signal intensity, myoc mean, of myoc, successive lower - bound threshold based region - growing scheme are run for an iteratively decreasing threshold, using the same seed as above. eventually, region growth breaks through the myoc, effusing into bright surrounding structures ( fat, right ventricle, or muscle ), causing a sudden increase in the apparent segmented volume, which can be characterized by a discontinuity in a ratio of consecutive volume growth. the discontinuity of volume growth during decreasing region - growing threshold is used to measure the threshold at which region - growth has penetrated the myoc. the threshold at which region - growth effuses into surrounding structures is considered as the mean signal intensity, myoc mean, of the myoc. to segment lv region, region growing is performed again for the last time within that slice or phase image using an absolute threshold of myocmean + n lvstd, where n = 2. accounting for gaussian noise, the assignments ensure at least 99. 4 % of full - blood and full - myocardium voxels will be weighted correctly, while maintaining the proportionality of partial voxel interpolation. the total blood volume of the segmented lv is determined by the summation of pixels as follows : v = x h ( x ) w ( x ) where v is volume and h ( x ) is the histogram of the lv. w ( x ) is the weighting function associated with blood voxels of intensity x and defined as w ( x ) = ( x m ) / ( b m ), where b and m are the signal intensities associated with full - blood and full - myocardium voxels. accounting for gaussian noise, b and m are assigned ( lv mean n lv std ) and ( myoc mean + n lv std ) respectively, where n = 2. the pixels of the lv region above in this embodiment of the invention are always counted as full - blood. when w ( x ) = 1. 0, the blood volume of the lv is calculated without partial voxel effects. for epicardial contour extraction, a modified application specific active contour model algorithm ( acm ) is developed, as shown in fig2. active contour models, also called snakes, are can be formulated as, e snake = 0 1 { e internal c ( s ) + e external c ( s ) } ds, where c ( s ) is a list of contour points ( x ( s ), y ( s ) ), e internal is an internal energy caused by bending contours and e external is the attraction of image features such as edges. the points in the contour iteratively approach the boundary or edge of an object through the minimization of the snake energy. the internal energy function is defined as, e internal = ( s ) c s 2 + ( s ) 2 c s 2 2, where ( s ) is a measure of the elasticity of the acm and ( s ) is a measure of the stiffness of the acm. the external energy function is defined by calculating the image ( f ( x, y ) ) gradients as, a critical weakness of general acm is that it is susceptible to local minima ; therefore, the initial contour should be defined near the searching objects. if the initial contour is located far from objects, it is difficult to define the external force and hence it does not converge to the desired segmentation. in this application, the problem is simplified, the intensity constraint is applied, and the external force is generated using prior knowledge even where it is not clear what the direction of the force should be. these modifications for the epicardial contour extraction are expanded in the following 5 steps, shown in fig2 : 1. generate a circular map through polar mapping about the endocardial center of mass ( circular mapping step 180 ). 2. extract edge information ( edge extraction step 182 ), filter out the edge from the endocardium ( edge filtering step 184 ). 3. define the external force and constraint for the epicardial contour ( constraint conditioning step 186 ). 4. initialize contour at endocardial border ( contour initialization step 188 ) and apply the epicardial active contour model initialized at the endocardial contour ( contour growth and deformation step 190 ). 5. update the epicardial contour ( contour smoothing step 192 ) and transform the coordinates. since the lv has roughly a circular shape, we generate a circular map ( cmap ) by polar mapping, where the center of the polar mapping is the center - of - mass, such as a center of intensity, from the endocardial region in sec. 3. 1 or other convenient point. through this mapping, ( x, y ) cartesian image coordinates are converted to ( radius r, radian ) polar coordinates. the maximum radius is selected to cover all potential cardiac short - axis surface areas ( see, fig2 ). the upper left picture 194 of fig2 ( a ) is a slice to be segmented. the conversion of the picture 194 to polar coordinates is shown in fig2 ( b ). in the cmap, edge information is extracted by applying the canny edge extractor, the results of which are shown in fig2 ( c ). since the endocardial region is segmented from iterative thresholding, edge information that comes from the endocardial region is filtered out. in standard acms, the external force is only well defined near the targeted objects typically using the gradient vector force ( gvf ), and the external force far from the targeted objects are difficult to define. fig2 ( b ) shows the external force defined by gradients in an enlarged region of fig2 ( a ) where gradient values in the polygons 200 to which the arrows point are approximately zero. if a contour is seeded in those areas, there will be insufficient external force to move the contour. in our lv segmentation applications, the contour is initialized at the endocardial border of lv as determined above. for extracting the epicardial border, the initialized contour should move iteratively in the direction of increasing radius r. this prior knowledge can be used to condition the external force for effectively moving the contour in the following manner. after gradient calculation, gradients less than a pre - defined threshold are set to the right nearest gradients that are greater than the threshold. the result of setting gradients to the right can be seen in fig2 ( c ). the threshold used in this study was 0. 03 ( see fig2 ( c ) ). the information on myocardial intensity estimated from the iterative thresholding in section 3. 1 is used to further constrain the contour movement. let myoc max = myoc mean + 2. 0 lv std and myoc min = myoc mean 0. 4. regions where the intensity value is over myoc max or below myoc min ( see fig2 ( b ), ( c ), respectively ) and where the surface area is larger than 240 pixels are used as a constraint to block the movement of the contour. the active contour model guided the modified external force and the movement constraint in step 3 is then applied for lv segmentation. the initial contour is set at the lv endocardial border determined from iterative thresholding in section 3. 1 or, in general, any method for obtaining the endocardial border. while iteratively minimizing the energy, the contour is limited to only move in the radial direction r, and stops if it meets the movement constraint. the average difference between contour points before and after each iteration is calculated and iteration is stopped if the average difference is below 0. 01 pixels. fig3 shows the results after acm segmentation. the left contour line 202 represents the initial contour that is the endocardial border. the right contour line 204 represents the epicardial contour extracted by the acm segmentation. the arrows in fig3 ( b ) locate the points that stop moving by the constraint. fig3 ( a ) and 30 ( b ) show how the acm stops because of the myocardial intensity constraint ( as indicated by the arrows ). fig3 ( c ) and 30 ( d ) show how the acm stops where the edges are not defined or extracted ( as shown by the arrow ). since the epicardial contour from acm can have jagged patterns, a low - pass filter is applied to smooth the contour. then, the epicardial contour is transformed in the image domain by a simple inverse calculation of polar mapping. to evaluate the aforementioned method, data were acquired from cardiac mri examinations previously performed on numerous patients ( 15 male, mean age 52. 4 years 15. 1 standard deviation ). cine ssfp scans were performed using a ge signa 1. 5t scanner, imaging parameters tr 3. 3 - 4. 5 ms, te 1. 1 - 2. 0 ms, flip angle 55 - 60, matrix size 192 192 - 256 256, image dimensions 256 256, receiver bandwidth 125 khz, fov 290 - 400 240 - 360, slice thickness and slice gap 6 - 8 mm & amp ; 2 - 4 mm, respectively ( total 10 mm ). the lv in each patient was imaged in 6 - 10 slices, 20 - 28 cardiac phases. a total of 339 images from 38 patients were segmented by the iterative thresholding and active contour model with adaptation ( ithaca ) segmentation, with results compared to both manual tracing and to the commercial mass software. manual tracing was performed by an experienced physician with ptm & # 39 ; s excluded from the blood volume. ptm were defined as myocardium protruding & gt ; 1. 5 mm from the circumferential contour of the lv cavity, with equivalent signal intensity to the adjacent lv wall. endocardial and myocardial volumes at diastole were measured using our ithaca segmentation algorithm and the mass software and compared with manual tracing. calculated volumes are presented without partial volume interpolation. although not utilized to gather the present data, recall that lv segmentation using iterative thresholding can calculate partial volume considering lv and myoc intensity statistics. the difference between epicardial volume and endocardial volume is the myocardial volume which, multiplied by the known myocardial density of 1. 05 g / ml, gives the myocardial mass. linear regression and bland - altman analysis was performed to assess correlation between manual tracing, our ithaca segmentation algorithm, and the mass software. blood volume from manual tracing, our ithaca segmentation, and the mass software were 144. 5 ml 50. 0 ( average standard deviation ), 141. 6 ml 48. 7, and 164. 5 ml 55. 1, respectively. myocardial mass from manual tracing, ithaca segmentation, and the mass software were 128. 1 50. 9 g, 128. 9 49. 0 g, and 129. 1 57. 5 g, respectively. comparisons on these measurements are summarized in tables 1 and 2 ( fig3 and 32, respectively ) and fig3 and 34. blood volumes measured from our ithaca algorithm and the mass software correlated highly with that from manual tracing ( r2 = 0. 99 ), and myocardial mass measurements were fairly correlative ( r2 = 0. 90 and 0. 88 for ithaca and mass respectively ). the bland - altman analysis ( fig3 ) indicated that the myocardial mass measurements agreed with each other very well, the blood volume measured from the ithaca algorithm agreed well with that from manual tracing, but the blood volume measured from the mass software was substantially higher than that from manual tracing due to the inclusion of ptm & # 39 ; s in the lv blood by the mass software. the performances of the ithaca algorithm and the mass software were summarized in table 2 ( fig3 ). an example case of segmentation using all three methods is illustrated in fig3. counting from the top, the first row of pictures in fig3 are of original images. the second and third rows show segmented lv regions and myocardiums, respectively, by the ithaca method. the fourth and fifth rows show results for the mass algorithm before manual intervention and after manual intervention, respectively. either of these two automated software were judged to fail when it generated a contour that deviated from the ventricle border by more than 10 % in area as visually estimated by the operator, as illustrated in fig3. when this occurred, the operator performed manual correction on the contour. both ithaca and mass software required manual intervention at some basalmost slices ( almost half of the patient cases ), because of the lack of myocardial enclosure. for generating endocardial contour, the mass software required manual intervention in most apical slices, and the ithaca algorithm eliminated this problem. for generating epicardial contour, the mass software required manual intervention for 51. 6 % slices, and the ithaca algorithm reduced the need for manual intervention to 1. 5 % slices ( near - complete automation ). the experimental data indicate that the ithaca segmentation algorithm is highly accurate and robust in segmenting the lv mass and blood volume. this ithaca algorithm provides a substantial improvement over the commercial mass software that requires frequently manual intervention in almost every patient. while automated segmentation at the cardiac basal slice remains a concern, the ithaca algorithm succeeds in eliminating the need for manual intervention at other slices ( mostly apical slices ) when segmenting the endocardial border and almost eliminates manual intervention when segmenting the epicardial border. comparison with the clinical standard of manual tracing suggests that the ithaca algorithm can be a valuable clinical tool for the rapid quantification of lv stroke volume, ejection fraction, and myocardial mass. the ithaca algorithm starts to extract the endocardial border using the geometric assumption that bright blood is surrounded by dimmer myocardium. this simple assumption does not require specific lv shape knowledge, and it is valid for all slices except for the basalmost slice where the lv outflow tract disrupts the closure of myocardium. by seeding at the lv blood, the blood and myocardium signal intensity profile can be estimated from region growth through iterative thresholding. the critical threshold is identified by the abrupt increase in region growth. this iterative thresholding approach in guiding region growth turns out to be very robust in automatically extracting lv blood. the ithaca algorithm extracts the outer epicardial border using the active contour model ( acm ), which is adapted to or guided by the endocardial border and signal intensity profile already determined from the first part of iterative thresholding. the external force is conditioned to drive the contour from the endocardial border towards the epicardial border, and the search for epicardial border is further efficiently localized by blocking from areas with intensity above or below myocardial signal. this adaptation makes the acm converge rapidly onto the epicardial border through a few iterations. our experimental data indicate that this acm with adaptation is quite robust in automatically extracting the epicardial border, enabling estimation of the lc myocardial mass. the ithaca algorithm did not eliminate the need for manual intervention when extracting the epicardial border in 1. 5 % of slices, where the signal intensity difference between myocardium and surrounding tissues ( lung or liver ) was almost zero. experienced clinicians can draw a separation between myocardium and its surrounding based upon their training. this a priori knowledge of epicardial border shape may be incorporated in the conditioning of the acm. similarly, a priori knowledge of the outflow tract at the basalmost slice for the endocardial border may be incorporated to condition the region growth and completely eliminate manual intervention. on the other hand, the ithaca algorithm may be more accurate at segmenting complex borders than manual tracing, causing a slight disagreement between manual tracing and our ithaca algorithm. this kind of segmentation error was under 10 % and was not corrected by user - intervention. all references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein. the use of the terms a and an and the and similar referents in the context of describing the invention ( especially in the context of the following claims ) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. the terms comprising, having, including, and containing are to be construed as open -

semiconductor nanoparticle aggregate of the present invention, the present inventors conducted diligent investigations and found that in order to decrease the size of semiconductor nanoparticles ( hereinafter also referred to as quantum dots ) according to the present invention, it was necessary to decrease exciton - bohr radius, and a requirement for realizing the above was that the bulk band

is si. incidentally, an ultra - small amount of a dope material such as ga may be incorporated, if appropriate. as semiconductor materials used for a shell, various types of semiconductor materials can be employed. there are specifically listed, for example, zno, zns, znse, znte, cdo, cds, cdse, cdte, mgs, mgse, gas, gan, gap, gaas, gasb, inas, inn, inp, insb, alas, aln, alp, and alsb, or mixtures thereof. incidentally, preferable shell materials include semiconductive materials exhibiting a higher band gap than a semiconductive nanocrystal core. in addition to having higher band gap energy than a semiconductive fine particle crystal core, materials suitable for a shell needs to exhibit excellent conductivity and atomic valence band offset with respect to a core semiconductive nanocrystal. therefore, the conductive band is preferably higher than that of the core semiconductive nanocrystal, and the atomic valence band is preferably lower than that of the core semiconductive nanocrystal. for a semiconductive nanocrystal core emitting energy in the visible region ( e. g., si, ge, and gap ) or in the near - infrared region ( e. g., inp, inn, pbs, and pbse ), materials having band gap energy in the uv region can be used. specific examples include, for example, zns, gan, and magnesium chalcogenides ( e. g., mgs, mgse, and mgte ). in the present invention, specifically preferable semiconductor materials are sio 2 and zns. to produce the semiconductor nanoparticle of the present invention, various types of methods conventionally known in the art can be employed. production methods employing a liquid phase method include a coprecipitation method, a sol - gel method, a homogeneous precipitation method, and a reduction method, all of which are precipitation methods. in addition, a reverse - micelle method and a supercritical hydrothermal synthesis method are excellent methods to produce nanoparticles ( for example, refer to jp - a nos. 2002 - 322468, 2005 - 239775, 10 - 310770, and 2000 - 104058 ). as production methods employing a gas phase method, there are used ( 1 ) a method wherein facing raw material semiconductors are evaporated with a first high - temperature plasma generated between electrodes, followed by being passed through a second high - temperature plasma generated via electrodeless discharging under reduced pressure ( for example, refer to jp - a no. 6 - 279015 ), and ( 2 ) a method wherein nanoparticles are separated and removed from an anode composed of a raw material semiconductor via electrochemical etching ( for example, refer to japanese translation of pct international application publication no. 2003 - 515459 ) or a laser abrasion method ( for example, refer to jp - a no. 2004 - 356163 ). further, there is preferably used a method wherein a raw material gas is subjected to a gas phase reaction under reduced pressure to synthesize powder incorporating particles. as a method for producing the semiconductor nanoparticle of the present invention, a production method specifically employing a liquid phase method is preferable. incidentally, to realize uniformity of the particle diameter and the emission intensity of a semiconductor nanoparticle according to the present invention, it is necessary to form a semiconductor nanoparticle having less lattice defects and exhibiting enhanced crystallinity by optimizing the purity of a raw material, the synthesis concentration, the synthesis temperature and duration, and the anneal temperature and duration after particle formation. the semiconductor nanoparticle aggregate of the present invention is adaptable to a biological substance fluorescent labeling agent. further, when added to a living cell or a living body having a target ( trace ) substance, a biological substance labeling agent according to the present invention is bonded or adsorbed to the target substance. thereafter, the resulting bonded or adsorbed body is irradiated with excitation light of a predetermined wavelength and then fluorescence of a specific wavelength emitted from a fluorescent semiconductor fine particle based on the excitation light is detected. thereby, fluorescent dynamic imaging of the target ( trace ) substance can be carried out. namely, the biological substance labeling agent of the present invention can be utilized in a bioimaging method ( a technological method to visualize biological molecules constituting a biological substance and dynamic phenomena thereof ). the surface of the above semiconductor nanoparticle aggregate is usually hydrophobic. therefore, for example, in the case of use as a biological substance labeling agent, the aggregate as such exhibits poor water dispersibility, resulting in agglomerated particles which are problematic, whereby the shell surface of a core / shell type semiconductor nanoparticle is preferably hydrophilized. a method of hydrophilization includes, for example, a method wherein lipophilic groups on the surface are removed with pyridine and then a surface modifier is allowed to bond to the particle surface in at least one manner of a chemical and a physical manner. as the surface modifier, those containing a carboxyl group or an amino group as a hydrophilic group are preferably used. there are specifically listed, for example, mercaptopropionic acid, mercaptoundecanoic acid, and aminopropanethiol. specifically, for example, 10 5 g of a ge / geo 2 type nanoparticle is dispersed in 10 ml of purified water dissolving 0. 2 g of mercaptoundecanoic acid and stirred at 40 c. for 10 minutes, followed by surface treatment of the shell to modify the shell surface of the inorganic nanoparticle with a carboxyl group. a biological substance labeling agent according to the present invention is obtained by allowing the above hydrophilized semiconductor nanoparticle to bond to a molecule labeling agent via an organic molecule. a biological substance labeling agent according to the present invention can label a biological substance in such a manner that a molecule labeling substance is specifically allowed to bond to and / or react with the targeted biological substance. such a molecule labeling substance includes, for example, a nucleotide chain, an antibody, an antigen, and cyclodextrin. in a biological substance labeling agent according to the present invention, a hydrophilized semiconductor nanoparticle is bonded to a molecule labeling agent via an organic molecule. the organic molecule is not specifically limited, if being an organic molecule allowing a semiconductor nanoparticle and a molecule labeling agent to join together. for example, of proteins, there are preferably used albumin, myoglobin, and casein, as well as avidin, a type of protein, combined with biotin. the above bonding embodiment is not specifically limited, including covalent bonding, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, coordination bonding, physical adsorption, and chemical adsorption. from the viewpoint of bonding stability, bonding featuring a strong bonding force such as covalent bonding is preferable. specifically, when a semiconductor nanoparticle is hydrophilized with mercaptoundecanoic acid, avidin and biotin can be used as organic molecules. in this case, the carboxyl group of the hydrophilized nanoparticle is preferably covalent bonded to avidin, which is then selectively bonded to biotin. thereafter, the biotin is further bonded to a biological substance labeling agent to give a biological substance labeling agent. the present invention will now be detailed with reference to examples that by no means limit the scope of the present invention. a mixed gas of monosilane gas and argon gas was introduced at 0. 7 l / minute and 19. 3 l / minute, respectively, into a reaction pipe made of quartz glass kept at 820 c. and 50 kpa to perform reaction for 0. 5 hour. then, powder was formed at the bottom of the reaction pipe. the reaction pipe was cooled, and then 1 mg of the powder was mixed with 100 ml of decane to disperse a si semiconductor nanoparticle in the decane via ultrasonic dispersion. the resulting solution is designated as sample 1. this nanoparticle was classified via size - exclusion chromatography. a reversed - phase ods ( octadecylsilyl group c - 18 ) column was used as the column. acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase and allowed to pass through the column at a flow rate of 0. 1 ml / minute. an absorption spectrum of 365 nm was measured over time and then absorption was confirmed in the range of 3 minutes - 30 minutes. sampling was carried out at 6 time points of 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes each for 30 seconds to prepare samples 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3, 1 - 4, 1 - 5, and 1 - 6. using a high - resolution transmission electron microscope ( tem ) photography, average particle diameter and particle diameter distribution were measured with respect to 100 semiconductor nanoparticles. herein, the following relationship is defined : average particle diameter distribution = the number percent of particles falling within 50 % of the average particle diameter. using hitachi spectrophotometer f7000, the emission spectrum of each of 6 types of the semiconductor nanoparticles was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm to carry out comparison among maximum emission wavelength intensities. xps measurement verified that the composition was si. the band gap value of the bulk si is 1. 12 ev. a three - necked flask was charged with trioctylphosphine selenide ( 6. 15 g, 7. 5 mm ) and trioctylphosphine oxide ( 19. 33 g, 50 mm ), followed by temperature adjustment at 300 c. during vigorous stirring, cadmium acetate dihydrate ( 1. 97 g, 7. 5 mm ) was rapidly introduced, and thereafter stirring was carried out for 5 hours while the temperature was kept at 250 c. the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, and then ethanol was added thereto, followed by centrifugal separation. the supernatant liquid was removed and the deposit was redispersed in decane to obtain sample 2 which was a cdse nanoparticle solution. sample 2 was classified via size - exclusion chromatography. a reversed - phase ods ( octadecylsilyl group c - 18 ) column was used as the column. acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase and allowed to pass through the column at a flow rate of 0. 05 ml / minute. an absorption spectrum of 365 nm was measured over time and then absorption was confirmed in the range of 1 minute - 20 minutes. sampling was carried out at 3 time points of 10, 15, and 20 minutes each for 15 seconds to prepare samples 2 - 1, 2 - 2, and 2 - 3. using a high - resolution transmission electron microscope ( tem ) photography, average particle diameter and particle diameter distribution were measured with respect to 100 nanoparticles. herein, the following relationship is defined : average particle diameter distribution = the number percent of particles falling within 50 % of the average particle diameter. using hitachi spectrophotometer f7000, the emission spectrum of each of 3 types of the semiconductor nanoparticles was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm to carry out comparison among maximum emission wavelength intensities. xps measurement verified that the composition was cdse. the band gap value of the bulk cdse is 1. 74 ev. the above result shows that cdse, which is outside of the scope of the present invention, can exhibit no visible light range emission when the size thereof is at most 4 nm. there was redispersed 1 10 5 g of each of various types of the si semiconductor nanoparticles prepared in example 1 in 10 ml of purified water dissolving 0. 2 g of mercaptoundecanoic acid, followed by being stirred at 40 c. for 10 minutes to give various types of surface - hydrophilized nanoparticles. thereafter, 25 mg of avidin was added to a solution of each of various types of the surface - hydrophilized nanoparticles, followed by being stirred at 40 c. for 10 minutes to prepare avidin - conjugated nanoparticles. a biotinylated oligonucleotide having a known base sequence was mixed with an obtained avidin - conjugated nanoparticle solution while stirring to prepare a nanoparticle - labeled oligonucleotide. the above labeled oligonucleotide was dropped onto a dna chip tightly holding oligonucleotides having various base sequences, followed by washing. then, it was shown that of these, only the spot of an oligonucleotide, having a base sequence complementary to that of the labeled oligonucleotide, emitted light of different color based on the particle diameter of the semiconductor nanoparticle via uv irradiation. the above result showed that oligonucleotide labeling was able to be carried out using the semiconductor nanoparticle of the present invention.","this invention provides a semiconductor nanoparticle aggregate

"referring now to the drawings in more detail and initially to fig1 numeral 10 designates a horizontal pipe which is embedded in a concrete slab 12 having only its upper surface 14 accessible. a vertical pipe 16 is connected with the horizontal pipe 10 by a weld 18. the pipes 10 and 16 may carry industrial process fluids, and the weld 18 may be at a critical area in which weld failure could lead to the leakage of the process fluid or other adverse consequences. the piping system may be a critical one such as a system which conducts cooling fluid for a nuclear power plant or some other critical facility. because the pipes 10 and 16 are embedded in the concrete 12, the weld 18 is not accessible for inspection. the concrete 12 is relatively impervious to ultrasonic signals so that ultrasonic signals applied from the accessible surface 14 cannot be used in a practical manner for reliable inspection of the weld 18. in accordance with the present invention, a flexible waveguide 20 is embedded in the concrete slab 12 when it is poured or otherwise initially constructed. the waveguide 20 is arranged with its free end 22 located adjacent to and pointed at the weld 18. the waveguide 20 may have a serpentine shape or any other suitable shape, and its opposite end 24 is located adjacent to the accessible surface 14 or at some other accessible location. a collar 26 located on top of the slab surface 14 provides a port to permit detachable connection of ultrasonic equipment to the accessible end 24 of the waveguide 20 as will be explained in more detail. a conventional ultrasonic pulser - receiver controls an ultrasonic transducer 30. a tapered transition piece 32 which is preferably of a frusto conical configuration connects with the transducer 30 and may be fitted at its lower or smaller end closely within the collar 26. this couples the small end of the transition piece 32 with the waveguide 20. the transducer 30 transmits ultrasonic signals which are applied to the transition piece 32 and from the transition piece to the end 24 of waveguide 20. the signals are transmitted along the length of the waveguide to its opposite end 22 and then to the area of the weld 18. ultrasonic echoes are reflected from the area of the weld back to the end 22 and along the length of the waveguide 20 to end 24. the reflected signals are transmitted through the transition piece 32 to the transducer 30. in this manner, the transducer system and waveguide act to provide an ultrasonic image of the weld 18 to permit detection of any problems in the weld that could lead to leakage of fluid or otherwise adversely affect the process. as described, the transducer 30 acts as both a transmitter of ultrasonic signals and as a receiver of the reflected signals. an alternative arrangement would be to provide one transducer acting as a transmitter and a second transducer acting as a receiver, with the transmitted signals traveling along one path defined by the waveguide 20 and the reflected signals traveling along a different path provided by the waveguide. in addition, the transducer equipment can be permanently attached to the waveguide end 24 rather than being detachable in the manner previously described. the flexibility of the waveguide 20 is important, as it allows the waveguide to be bent, curved or formed in virtually any other desired configuration. the surface 14 immediately above the weld 18 may be inaccessible in some applications, and the ability of the waveguide to be shaped as desired thus becomes essential. as shown in fig2 the transition piece 32 may be a solid element constructed of a material that is suitable for the transmission of ultrasonic signals. alternatively, as shown in fig3 the transition piece 32 may be a hollow element having its interior filled with a liquid 34 that is suitable for the transmission of ultrasonic signals. in either case, the transition element 32 provides a tapered transition between the transducer 30 and the smaller waveguide 24 which, in the case of fig2 and 3, is formed by a single fiber. the fiber may be constructed of quartz or some other material that has suitable acoustic properties for transmitting ultrasonic signals. fig4 depicts an ultrasonic system for inspecting one or more welds 36 which are used to connect a fitting 38 in extension through one wall of a liquid storage tank 40. the tank 40 contains liquid 42 which may be a petroleum based liquid, a chemical that is potentially dangerous, or some other type of liquid. the fitting 38 is submerged well below the surface 44 of the liquid 42 where access to it is restricted. the welds 36 are critical to the liquid storage facility, and leakage or other problems that develop at the welds can lead to serious adverse consequences. in accordance with the present invention, a flexible waveguide 46 can be manipulated such that its free end 48 is positioned adjacent to the weld 36 that is to undergo inspection. the waveguide 46 may be flexed in a serpentine shape or any other desired configuration, and its opposite end 50 connects with a transition piece 52 which may be of the type shown in either fig2 or fig3 or some other type if desired. the opposite or large end of the transition piece 52 connects with a conventional ultrasonic transducer 54 which operates to apply ultrasonic signals to the transition piece 52 and to receive reflected signals which are returned to the transition piece by the waveguide 46. manipulation of the waveguide 46 as desired is carried out by a conventional manipulating device 56 which functions in a manner known to those skilled in the field of manipulation of long flexible objects such as the waveguide 46. again, the flexibility of the waveguide is important because it allows positioning of the waveguide as necessary to reach the critical area. the equipment may also include a conventional video monitor 58. the waveguide end 50 and the components connected with it are situated at a fixed location above the liquid level in the tank and preferably close to the tank. in operation, the transducer 54 transmits ultrasonic signals which are applied to the transition piece 52 and then to the waveguide which directs the signals toward the weld 36. the reflected echo signals are received by the tip 48 of the waveguide and transmitted back along the waveguide to the transition piece 52 and the transducer 54 in order to provide an ultrasonic image of the weld area. the ultrasonic image can be examined to detect any flaws or other problems in the weld 36 or at any other critical area that is inaccessible for inspection by conventional techniques. fig5 depicts a dual element system in which a pair of ultrasonic transducers 60 and 62 are used. the transducer 60 is provided with a pair of side by side fibers 64 and 66. fiber 64 is used for the transmission of ultra sonic signals toward the area that is to be inspected, as indicated by the directional arrow 64 a. the other fiber 66 is used for the transmission of reflected echo pulses as indicated by the directional arrow 66 a. the tips of the fibers 64 and 66 are turned to the side such that the ultrasonic signals that are transmitted and received by them have a horizontal orientation, as the arrows 64 a and 66 a illustrate. this shows one version of a possible multiple element system. the other transducer 62 has a pair of side by side fibers 68 and 70. fiber 68 is used for the transmission of ultrasonic signals toward the area that is to be inspected, as indicated by the directional arrow 68 a. the other fiber 70 is used for the receipt of reflected ultrasonic signals, as indicated by the directional arrow 70 a. the tips of the fibers 68 and 70 are directed downwardly so that the ultrasonic signals they transmit and receive have a vertical orientation, as the arrows 68 a and 70 a illustrate. by using the dual element transducer shown in fig5 inspections can be carried out at the same time in different directions. in many applications, this can facilitate and expedite the inspection procedure and provide ultrasonic imaging information that is complete as to the entire area that is undergoing inspection. additional fibers can be provided and directed at different orientations if desired. the waveguides 20 ( fig1 ) and 46 ( fig4 ) can include a single fiber or virtually any number of fibers which are arranged in a fiber bundle which may be of the type shown in fig6. the individual fibers 72 are packed closely together in the bundle which is depicted in fig6. in a waveguide which includes a bundle of fibers, the individual fibers are connected together in the same configuration at both ends of the waveguide but may be disconnected between the opposite ends of the waveguide. this provides the necessary flexibility of the waveguide while assuring accuracy because the locations of the ends of the different fibers are known. an alternative arrangement of a multiple fiber bundle which comprises the waveguide is shown in fig7. here, the individual fibers 72 are arranged in ordered rows of fibers which may or may not be packed so closely as to touch one another. fig7 depicts the individual fibers spaced apart from each other. in the type of bundle shown in fig6 or the type shown in fig7 the individual fiber 72 may serve different functions. for example, some of the fibers 72 are used for the transmission of ultrasonic signals from the transducer and others may be used for the transmission of reflected signals back toward the transducer ( or some of the fibers may perform both functions ). other fibers may be used for illuminating the tip end of the waveguide 46. these fibers 72 may be optical fibers of the type that are able to transmit light from a suitable light source such as a laser located in the above ground equipment. other of the fibers 72 in the bundle may be optical fibers used to transmit optical images from the tip end 48 of the waveguide back to the above ground equipment for display on the video monitor 78. this permits the operator of the equipment to view the area immediately ahead of the waveguide tip 48 in order to enhance his ability to properly manipulate the waveguide so that its tip is positioned properly for inspecting the weld 36. thus, an actual optical image of the weld 36 may be displayed on the video monitor 58 in order to assist in the proper positioning of the waveguide, and the ultrasonic image of the weld is separately generated for the purpose of inspecting the integrity of the weld or other component that is undergoing examination. it should be noted that the waveguide may be a probe which moves independently within a larger tube, either axially or rotationally or both. it should also be noted that various types of operations can be carried out along with the inspection. for example, a laser or cutting device can be combined with the waveguide and used to remove unwanted deposits or other material. the ultrasonic imaging equipment provides feedback for use in controlling the removal process. in addition to the specific applications which are illustrated in the drawings, the flexible waveguide system of the present invention has use in a wide variety of industrial applications. by way of example, laser bored holes are known to be relatively irregular, and the system of this invention can be used to provide an image of the hole geometry and determine the extent of the irregularities. chemical machining of large surfaces such as panels used in aircraft construction is a commonly used process. a flexible quartz waveguide constructed according to the present invention could be used to make ultrasonic measurements of the part without requiring the part to be removed from the chemical bath as is currently required. the quartz is inert to chemical attack and would greatly improve the process efficiency as well as reducing the errors which can lead to ruined panels. environments which are otherwise hostile because of chemicals, radiation or other dangerous materials can be made accessible through use of the waveguide. the monitoring of interior surfaces of vessels or pipe networks is also made possible. chemical processes can likewise be monitored because the waveguide is able to withstand chemical attack whereas transducers cannot be directly placed at the site of the chemical reactions because caustic chemicals would quickly destroy them. measurement of pitting caused by corrosion or other deterioration of airframe structures or critical areas in chemical plants is also made possible by embedding the waveguide in the structure which is to be monitored. the monitoring of various other inaccessible areas such as surfaces which are subject to degradation or unwanted deposits can also be carried out. from the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects hereinabove set forth together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure. it will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. this is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims. since many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.","a method and apparatus which uses ultrasonic techniques to inspect critical pipe joints and other critical industrial areas that are normally inaccessible . a waveguide including one or more

"now, referring to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. the same component elements will be given with the same reference numerals and the descriptions thereof will be omitted. fig1 is a block diagram showing an x - ray imaging system including a phase information restoring apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. this x - ray imaging system has an imaging unit 1 for irradiating the object with an x - ray so as to output detection data that represents image information of an object, a phase information restoring apparatus 2 for generating image data based on the detection data, a display unit 3 for displaying a visible image based on the image data, and an output unit 4 for printing out the visible image on a film etc. fig2 is a diagram showing a structure of the imaging unit 1. as a x - ray source 11, it is desirable to use a x - ray source generating a radiation beam that is highly coherent and monochromatic. here, the highly monochromatic beam indicates a beam that mainly has a single wavelength. for this purpose, in the embodiment, a synchrotron radiation source that generates x - rays is used as the x - ray source 11. the synchrotron radiation is an electromagnetic wave that is generated by accelerating an electron or bending a traveling direction of an electron. the x - ray generated from the x - ray source 11 is transmitted through an object 10 and enters a sensor 12. the sensor 12 detects the incident x - ray. as the sensor 12, a two - dimensional sensor such as a ccd ( charge coupled device ) having a plurality of detecting elements that convert intensity of the applied x - ray into electric signals and output the signals is used. the detection signal output from the sensor 12 is amplified by an amplifier 15, converted into a digital signal ( detection data ) by an a / d converter 16, and output to the phase information restoring apparatus 2. the sensor 12 is held by a holding portion 13. the holding portion 13 is movably supported on a rail 14. the position of the holding portion 13 is controlled by a control unit, which will be described later, of the phase information restoring apparatus 2, and a distance between the object 10 and the sensor 12 is changed under the control of the control unit. note that the distance between the object 10 and the sensor 12 is referred to as an imaging distance hereinafter. referring to fig1 again, the phase information restoring apparatus 2 has a storage unit 21 for temporarily storing the detection data output from the imaging unit 1, a differential processing unit 22 for obtaining a differential coefficient between detection data at different imaging distances and a differential coefficient between detection data at the same imaging distance, a laplacian processing unit 23 for calculating a value that corresponds to a laplacian of phase, an inverse laplacian processing unit 24 for performing inverse laplacian operation for phase restoration, an image processing unit 25 for generating image data on the basis of the restored phase information, and a control unit 26 for controlling the respective units 21 25 and the imaging distance in the imaging unit 1. the phase information restoring apparatus 2 may be configured with a digital circuit or software and a cpu. with a cpu, the control unit 26 including the cpu processes the detection data on the basis of a phase information restoring program recorded on a recording medium 27. as the recording medium 27, a flexible disk, a hard disk, an mo, an mt, a ram, a cd - rom, a dvd - rom, etc. are applicable. the display unit 3 is a display device such as a crt, and displays a visible image based on image data that represents the phase information restored by the phase information restoring apparatus 2. the output unit 4 is a laser printer, for example, and prints out the visible image on a film etc. on the basis of the image data. next, a principle of a phase information restoring method according to the present invention will be described. the phase information restoring method according to the present invention is a method of constructing a visible image by the phase - contrast method, and the phase restoration is performed on the basis of plural diffraction fringe images obtained with respect to an object by using the basic expression of phase restoration, tie ( transport of intensity equation ). tie expressed by the following expression ( 5 ) is transformed so as to obtain expression ( 6 ). - i ( x, y ) z = { i ( x, y ) ( x, y ) } ( 5 ) - i ( x, y ) z = i ( x, y ) 2 ( x, y ) + i ( x, y ) ( x, y ) = i ( x, y ) 2 ( x, y ) + i ( x, y ) x ( x, y ) x + i ( x, y ) y ( x, y ) y ( 6 ) where i ( x, y ) is detection data representing intensity of diffracted x - ray at a position ( x, y ) on a plane at a distance of z from the object. in expression ( 6 ), the laplacian 2 ( x, y ) and the gradients ( ( x, y ) x, ( x, y ) y ) of the phase ( x, y ) to be obtained are unknown. if at least three gradients i = ( i / x, i / y, i / z ) of the intensity of the diffracted x - ray can be obtained, expression ( 6 ) can be solved. substituting elements of the gradients i 1 to i 3 of the intensity of the diffracted x - ray into expression ( 6 ), it is expressed with matrices by expression ( 7 ). - ( i 1 ( x, y ) z i 2 ( x, y ) z i 3 ( x, y ) z ) = ( i 1 ( x, y ) i 1 ( x, y ) x i 1 ( x, y ) y i 2 ( x, y ) i 2 ( x, y ) x i 2 ( x, y ) y i 3 ( x, y ) i 3 ( x, y ) x i 3 ( x, y ) y ) ( 2 ( x, y ) ( x, y ) x ( x, y ) y ) ( 7 ) expression ( 7 ) can be solved using an inverse matrix, for example. as described above, in the embodiment, approximation in tie is minimized to raise the accuracy of the phase restoration and the operation is simplified by using a matrix form. next, referring to fig1 3, the phase information restoring method according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. fig3 is a flowchart showing the phase information restoring method according to the first embodiment of the present invention. in the embodiment, a visible image is constructed by using detection data representing six diffraction fringe images taken while changing the imaging distance as shown in fig2. first, at step s 1, x - ray imaging is performed. the sensor 12 is positioned at the position where the imaging distance is z 1 as shown in fig2 and irradiating the object 10 with an x - ray so as to perform the x - ray imaging. then, the sensor 12 moved to the position where the imaging distance is ( z 1 + z 1 ) and the x - ray imaging is performed. similarly, the x - ray imaging is repeated with the sensor positioned at the imaging distances of z 2, ( z 2 + z 2 ), z 3, and ( z 3 + z 3 ). thereby, the detection data representing diffraction fringe images are obtained. by the x - ray imaging at step s 1, detection data i 1 ( x, y ), i 1 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 3 ( x, y ), and i 3 ( x, y ) are sequentially input to the phase information restoring apparatus 2. here, the detection data i 1 ( x, y ) represents intensity of the diffracted x - ray at the position ( x, y ) on a plane at the imaging distance of z 1. similarly, the detection data i 1 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 3 ( x, y ), and i 3 ( x, y ) represent intensity of the diffracted x -

i n ( x, y ) i ( x, y ) z ( 22 ) here, in expression ( 22 ), although the differential coefficient is divided by the detection data i n ( x, y ) at a shorter imaging distance, it may be divided by the detection data i n ( x, y ) at a longer imaging distance or by different detection data from that used when obtaining the differential coefficient. alternatively, the differential coefficient may be divided by detection data performed with lpf ( low pass filter ) processing. further, at step s 13, the inverse laplacian processing unit 34 performs inverse laplacian operation on the laplacian f ( x, y ) = 2 ( x, y ) of the phase obtained at step s 12 so as to obtain phase ( x, y ). note that the inverse laplacian operation in the inverse laplacian processing unit 34 is the same as that described using fig3 in the first embodiment of the present invention. next, at steps s 14 s 16, the back propagation processing unit 35 restores a phase of the x - ray just after transmitted through the object on the basis of the restored phase, the detection data i 1, i 2, and i 3 stored in the storage unit 31, and the imaging distances z 1, z 2, and z 3. hereinafter, a phase etc. of an x - ray just after transmitted through an object is referred to as a phase etc. at the position of the object in relation to a phase etc. of the x - ray at the imaging distance of z n. first, at step s 14, the back propagation processing unit 35 obtains x - ray wave n ( x, y ) at the imaging distance of z n on the basis of the phase n ( x, y ) restored at step s 13 and the detection data i n ( x, y ) stored in the first storage unit 31, using the following expression ( 23 ). n ( x, y ) = { square root over ( i n ( x, y ) ) } exp [ i n ( x, y ) ] ( 23 ) next, at step s 15, the back propagation processing unit 35 obtains x - ray wave n 0 ( x, y ) at the position of the object on the basis of the x - ray wave n ( x, y ) obtained at step s 14 using the following expression ( 24 ). n 0 ( x, y ) = h zn ( x, y ) * n ( x, y ) ( 24 ) further, at step s 16, the back propagation processing unit 35 calculates phase n 0 ( x, y ) at the position of the object on the basis of the x -

1 [ im [ n - & gt ; 0 ( x, y ) ] re [ n - & gt ; 0 ( x, y ) ] ] ( 25 ) where re [ ] and im [ ] are functions for obtaining the real part and the imaginary part, respectively. next, at step s 17, the average processing unit 37 calculates average phase 0 ( x, y ) at the position of the object on the basis of the phase 0 ( x, y ) at the position of the object stored in the second storage unit 36 using the following expression ( 26 ). then, at step s 18, the image processing unit 38 generates image data on the basis of the average phase 0 ( x, y ). that is, the image processing unit 38 converts the average phase 0 ( x, y ) in each pixel into data representing brightness and performs necessary image processing such as gradation processing and interpolation processing. at step s 19, the display unit 3 and the output unit 4 displays a visible image on a screen or a film on the basis of the image data generated as described above. although, in the embodiment, the method of restoring phase by using three differential coefficients obtained from six interference fringe images taken while changing the imaging distance is described, the phase restoration may be performed on the basis of two differential coefficients, or the images used when obtaining different differential coefficients may be duplicated. next, a phase information restoring apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described. fig7 is a block diagram showing an x - ray imaging system including the phase information restoring apparatus according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. this x - ray imaging system includes a phase information restoring apparatus 8 instead of the phase information restoring apparatus 7 in fig5. other construction is the same as that in fig5. the phase information restoring apparatus 8 has a first storage unit 31 for temporarily storing the detection data output from the imaging unit 1, a differential processing unit 32 for obtaining a differential coefficient between detection data at different imaging distances, a laplacian processing unit 33 for calculating a value corresponding to a laplacian of phase, an inverse laplacian processing unit 34 for performing an inverse laplacian operation for performing phase restoration, a second storage unit 36 for temporarily storing the phase information at the position of the sensor output from the inverse laplacian processing unit 34, an average processing unit 37 for averaging plural pieces of phase information, an image processing unit 38 for generating image data based on the averaged phase information, and a control unit 39 for controlling the above respective units 31 38 and the imaging distance in the imaging unit 1. the phase information restoring apparatus 8 may be configured with a digital circuit or software and a cpu. next, a phase information restoring method according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described, referring to fig2, 7, and 8. fig8 is a flowchart showing the phase information restoring method according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. in the embodiment, a visible image is constructed by using image information representing six diffraction fringe images taken while changing the imaging distance. the method is characterized by using tie approximation expression expressed by expression ( 20 ) and performing appropriate approximation when constructing an operation expression so as to perform operation easily and speedy. first, at step s 20, x - ray imaging is performed. the sensor 12 is positioned at the position where the imaging distance is z 1 and the object 10 is irradiated with an x - ray as shown in fig2 so as to perform the x - ray imaging. subsequently, the sensor 12 moved to the position where the imaging distance is ( z 1 + z 1 ) and the x - ray imaging is similarly performed. further, the x - ray imaging is repeated with the sensor 12 positioned at the imaging distances of z 2, ( z 2 + z 2 ), z 3, and ( z 3 + z 3 ). thereby, the image information representing diffraction fringe images are obtained. by the x - ray imaging at step s 20, the detection data i 1 ( x, y ), i 1 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 3 ( x, y ), and i 3 ( x, y ) are sequentially input to the phase information restoring apparatus 8. here, the detection data i 1 ( x, y ) represents intensity of the diffracted x - ray at the position ( x, y ) on a plane at the imaging distance of z 1. similarly, the detection data i 1 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 2 ( x, y ), i 3 ( x, y ), and i 3 ( x, y ) represent intensity of the diffracted x - ray at the positions ( x, y ) on planes at the imaging distances of ( z 1 + z 1 ), z 2, ( z 2 + z 2 ), z 3, and ( z 3 + z 3 ), respectively. the detection data are sequentially stored in the first storage unit 31 of the phase information restoring apparatus 8. next, at steps s 21 s 23, the phase information restoring apparatus 8 restores a phase at the position of the sensor on the basis of the detection data stored in the first storage unit 31. first, at step s 21, the differential processing unit 32 obtains a differential coefficient between detection data i n and detection data i n. then, at step s 22, the laplacian processing unit 33 obtains laplacian f ( x, y ) = 2 ( x, y ) of a phase on the basis of the differential coefficient obtained at step s 21 and the detection data stored in the first storage unit 31. further, at step s 23, the inverse laplacian processing unit 34 performs an inverse laplacian operation on the laplacian f ( x, y ) = 2 ( x, y ) of the phase obtained at step s 22 so as to calculate phase ( x, y ). the calculated phase ( x, y ) is sequentially stored in the second storage unit 36. next, at step s 24, the average processing unit 37 calculates average phase 0 ( x, y ) based on the phase n ( x, y ) at the position of the sensor stored in the second storage unit 36. further, at step s 25, the image processing unit 38 generates image data based on the average phase 0 ( x, y ). that is, the image processing unit 38 converts the average phase 0 ( x, y ) in each pixel into data representing brightness and performs necessary image processing such as gradation processing and interpolation processing. at step s 26, the display unit 3 and the output unit 4 display a visible image on a screen or a film on the basis of the image data generated as described above. in the embodiment, the phases 1 to 3 at different imaging distances are averaged as at step 524. in the strict sense, these phases 1 to 3 include differences in accordance with the changes in the imaging distances in relation to the phase 0 at the position of the object. however, when a radiation source such as a synchrotron radiation source that generates a highly directional beam is used, these phases 1, 2, and 3 can be approximated equal to the phase 0 at the position of the object. further, averaging the phases 1 to 3 can cancel errors and bring the averaged phase closer to the real phase 0. although, in the first to fourth embodiments of the present invention described above, x - rays are used when imaging is performed on an object, any beam other than x - rays that can be transmitted through the object and form diffraction images, such as particle beams including an electron beam, may be used. further, in the first to fourth embodiments of the present invention, although a synchrotron radiation source is used when imaging is performed on an object, a radiation source generating beams other than synchrotron radiation may be used. for example, an electron storage type high brightness hard x - ray generator, which has been developed by ritsumeikan university, can generate x - rays having as high brightness and directivity as synchrotron radiation despite of its tabletop size. x - rays generated by this generator have coherency, and even though the x - rays have plural wavelengths, they can be monochromatized by combining with monochromatizing crystal. furthermore, the radiation source developed by the femtosecond technology research association ( festa ) generates ultrashort pulse high - brightness x - rays based on a principle of backward compton scattering. this ray source is compact and portable, and can generate x - rays having not only coherency but also high directivity and monochromaticity. note that, if a point source of radiation is used as a radiation source, it is desirable to correct the detection data to include magnification when performing data processing in the phase information restoring apparatus. next, a modified example of the x - ray imaging system including the phase information restoring apparatus according to the first to fourth embodiments of the present invention will be described. the x - ray imaging system shown in fig9 has a reading unit 5 and an imaging unit 6 instead of the imaging unit 1 in the x - ray imaging system shown in fig1. other construction is the same as that of the x - ray imaging system shown in fig1. in the imaging unit 6, as a screen used for recording image information, a photostimulable phosphor sheet ( recording sheet ) is used instead of the sensor 12 in the imaging unit 1 shown in fig2. the photostimulable phosphor ( storage phosphor ) is a material that, when applied with radiation, a part of the radiation energy is stored therein, and when applied with excitation light such as visible light afterward, light is photostimulably emitted in accordance with the stored energy. when a radiation image of an object such as a human body is taken and recorded on the sheet applied with the photostimulable phosphor, and scanned by the excitation light such as laser light, stimulated fluorescent light is generated. therefore, detection data can be obtained by reading the light photoelectrically. after the detection data is appropriately processed, the radiation image can be displayed as a visible image by outputting to a display such as a crt or printing out on a film by a laser printer etc. the reading unit 5 shown in fig9 is used for reading the radiation image recorded on the recording sheet. here, referring to fig1, construction and operation of the reading unit 5 will be described. the recording sheet 50 on which image information has been recorded is set in a predetermined position in the reading unit 5. the recording sheet 50 is carried in y - direction by a sheet carrying means 52 driven by a motor 51. on the other hand, a beam l 1 oscillating from the laser source 53 is reflected and deflected by a rotating polygon mirror 55 driven by a motor 54 and rotating at high speed in a direction of an arrow, and passes through a convergent lens 56. then, the beam l 1 changes its optical path by the mirror 57 and scans the recording sheet 50 in x - direction. by the scanning, excitation light l 2 is applied to the recording sheet 50, and stimulated fluorescent light l 3 having intensity in accordance with the stored and recorded radiation image information is emitted from the applied part. the stimulated fluorescent light l 3 is guided by the optical guide 58 and photoelectrically detected by a photomultiplier 59. an analogue signal output from the photomultiplier 59 is amplified by an amplifier 60 and digitized by an a / d converter 61. the detection data output from the a / d converter 61 is input to the phase information restoring apparatus 2. image information representing plural interference fringe images obtained at different imaging distances can be obtained by performing radiation imaging with the imaging distance changed and using plural recording sheets in the imaging unit 6, and reading image information from the respective recording sheets in the reading unit 5. the phase information restoring apparatus 2 performs phase restoration based on the image information and generates image data. the processing in the phase information restoring apparatus 2 is the same as that described using fig3. the x - ray imaging system shown in fig5 and 7 can also be modified into an x - ray imaging system using a photostimulable phosphor sheet similarly to that shown in fig9. as described above, according to the present invention, a high - accuracy phase restoration can be easily performed by minimizing approximation in tie and performing operation using matrices. thus, a visible image of good quality can be obtained by the phase - contrast method. further, according to the present invention, phase information of high accuracy can be obtained by averaging the plural restored phases to obtain the phase used as image data. therefore, a visible image of good quality in which noise is cancelled can be obtained by using the above phase information.","a method of restoring phase information using a phase - contrast method , which can improve estimated accuracy of a phase . this method is a method of restoring phase information by detecting intensity of radiation , and includes the steps of : obtaining three first differential signals representing differentials between one image signal and another image signal based on four image signals obtained by detecting intensity of radiation on four planes and representing radiation image information respectively ; obtaining second and third differential signals representing differentials between image signals relative to two directions orthogonal to each other within the planes with respect to the three image signals ; obtaining a laplacian of phase based on the three image signals and three sets of the first to third differential signals ; and performing inverse laplacian operation on the laplacian of phase so as to restore phase information ."
